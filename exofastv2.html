 NAME:
   BJD2TARGET
 PURPOSE:
   Iteratively calls TARGET2BJD to convert a BJD in Barycentric
   Dynamical Time (BJD_TDB) to a BJD in the target barycenter
   time (BJD_TARGET) within TOL days.

 DESCRIPTION:
   The opposite of TARGET2BJD; see description there.

 INPUTS:
   BJD_TDB     - A scalar or array of BJDs in TDB. Must be double
                 precision.
   INCLINATION - The inclination of the orbit
   A           - The semi-major axis of the orbit (AU)
   TP          - The time of periastron of the orbit (BJD_TARGET)
   PERIOD      - The period of the orbit (days)
   E           - Eccentricity of the orbit
   OMEGA       - Argument of Periastron of the orbit (radians)
   
 OPTIONAL INPUTS:
   Q          - The mass ratio of the targets (M1/M2). If not
                specified, an infinite mass ratio is assumed (M1 is
                stationary at the barycenter) (8 ms effect for Hot
                Jupiters).
   TOL        - The tolerance, in days. The iterative procedure will
                stop after the worst-case agreement is better than this.
                Default = 1d-8 (1 ms).

 OPTIONAL KEYWORDS:
   PRIMARY    - If set, the information comes from the position of
                the primary (as in RV), and therefore the correction
                will be the light travel time from the center of the
                primary to the Barycenter -- analagous to the
                difference between HJD and BJD in our solar system
                (only ~8 ms for Hot Jupiters, but increasing with a).    
                Otherwise, the correction will be the light
                travel time from the smaller body to the barycenter
                (as in transits) -- analagous to the difference
                between JD and BJD in the Solar System.

                NOTE: if Q is not specified and PRIMARY is, no
                correction is applied.

 OUTPUTS:
   BJD_TARGET - The time as it would flow in the Barycenter of the target.

 LIMITATIONS:
   We ignore the distance to the object (plane parallel waves), which
   should have a similar effect as the distance plays in the BJD
   correction (< 1 ms). We also ignore the systemic velocity, which
   will compress/expand the period by a factor gamma/c.

 NAME:
   COMPARESTARS_CORNER

 PURPOSE: 
   Creates a corner plot of several different fits overlaid on top
   of each other using the IDL save files as output by exofastv2.pro.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
   comparestars, 'savpath' [,TAGS=,LATEXNAMES=,LEGENDTXT=,PSNAME=]

 INPUTS:
  SAVPATH    - A string resolved by file_search or an array of
               filenames specifying the names of all the idl save
               files to compare.  
               See NSAMPLE if files are large
  TAGS       - A string array specifying the tagnames (parameters) to
               compare. Default is
               ['mstar','rstar','rhostar','logg','teff','feh','initfeh','age','lstar','eep']
  LATEXNAMES - A string array specifying the textoidl axis labels
               that corresponds to each of the tags above. If not the
               same length as TAGS, it will use the structure's latex
               property, but that doesn't always look pretty in
               textoidl. Empty strings will use the the structure's
               latex property.
  PSNAME     - A string specifying the name of the postscript file to
               output. If not specified, the plots are made to the
               screen.
  LEGENDTXT  - A string array corresponding to each save file that
               specifies the legend txt. Default is the filenames.
  NSAMPLE    - A scalar that specifies how many (random) samples to
               take from each parameter. Default uses all. Useful for
               memory management if plotting data from many large files
  POSITION   - A 2-element array specifying the normalized X and Y
               coordinates of the top left corner of the legend

 KEYWORDS:
    By default, the code will convert from time of inferior
    conjunction to time of minimum projected separation. The
    following keywords can change the inputs and outputs.

    TS_IN - Time of superior conjunction is the input time, time of
            minimum projected separation at secondary eclipse is the
            output
    TE_IN - Time of minimum projected separation at secondary eclipse
            is the input, time of superior conjunction is the output.
    TT_IN - Time of minimum rojected separation at primary eclipse
            is the input, time of inferior conjunction is the output.

    Given one time, eccentricity, inclination, omega, and period, we
    will return all other times:
       TC - Time of inferior conjunction, commonly reported as the
            transit time
       TT - Time of minimum projected separation. This is the
            intuitive definition of the transit time.
       TS - Time of superior conjunction, commonly reported as the
            secondary ecclipse time
       TE - The time of minimum projected separation during secondary
            eclipse.
       TP - Time of periastron

   the calculation of both so as not to duplicate the expensive
   calculation of alog10(1-k^2).

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
    ellke, k, ek, kk

 INPUTS:

    k - The elliptic modulus.

 OUTPUTS:

    ek - The elliptic integral of the first kind
    kk - The elliptic integral of the second kind

 INPUTS:

   PRIORFILE  - An ASCII file with each line containing 2-6 white
                space delimited columns:

                NAME VALUE WIDTH LOWERLIMIT UPPERLIMIT STARTING_VALUE
                
                NAME: must match a parameter.label. If in an array
                (e.g., of planets), add "_i", where "i" is the
                zero-indexed index into the array.

                VALUE: If less than 6 columns are supplied, this is
                the starting point of the fit. If this is the last
                value specified, this only changes the starting point
                and no prior is applied. If WIDTH is specified, this
                is the mean of the gaussian prior. 
 
                WIDTH: Standard deviation of a Gaussian prior. If
                negative, it is ignored (no Gaussian prior). If zero,
                the parameter is fixed to VALUE.
 
                LOWERLIMIT: Lower bound of a uniform prior. If -Inf,
                it is ignored.

                UPPERLIMIT: Upper bound of a uniform prior. If Inf,
                it is ignored.
  
                STARTING_VALUE: If specified, the fit will start here
                regardless of the Gaussian prior
 
                See
                $EXOFAST_PATH/parnames.README for a detailed
                explanation of this file and $EXOFAST_PATH/examples/
                for templates to use.
  PREFIX      - Each of the output files will have this string as a
                prefix. You can specify an absolute or relative
                path. If the directories do not exist, they will be
                created. The default is 'fitresults/planet.' to put
                all outputs in a fitresults subdirectory.

 DATA FILE INPUTS
  RVPATH      - A string specifying the path to the RV data
                file(s). Wildcards are allowed for multiple files
                (e.g., '*.rv'). Each file must have at least 3
                columns:
                   1) Time (BJD_TDB -- See Eastman et al., 2010)
                   2) RV (m/s)
                   3) err (m/s)

                If additional columns are supplied, they will be
                detrended against.

                The filenames of the RV data files *should* adhere
                to a certain format:

                planet_name.telescope.whateveryouwant.

                "telescope" is used as the legend text in figures
                and as header entries in the table.

                NOTE 1: The units must be as specified, or the fit
                will be wrong or fail. 
                NOTE 2: Other input time stamps will likely not
                break the code, but can introduce errors in the
                reported times of more than a minute. The output
                table will display BJD_TDB but makes no attempt to
                convert input times.  See
                http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010PASP..122..935E
                for an explanation of times
                NOTE 3: If RVPATH is omitted, no RV model will be
                generated.

  TRANPATH    - A string specifying the path to the transit data
                file(s). Wildcards are allowed for multiple files
                (e.g., '*.dat'). Each file must have at least 3
                columns:

                  1) Time (BJD_TDB -- See Eastman et al., 2010)
                  2) Normalized flux
                  3) err
                  4) Detrend parameter 1
                  ....
                  N+3) Detrend parameter N
       
                An optional header specifies which parameters
                should be multiplicatively detrended and which
                should be additively detrended. Without a header,
                all detrending parameters are additively detrended.
 
                The first character in the header line must be
                "#". It must have whitespace delimited columns
                corresponding to the data. Each multiplicative
                detrending variable is preceeded with "M" (case
                sensitive). For example, the header line

                #BJD_TDB FLUX ERR MAIRMASS SKY myval

                Will fit a multiplicative detrending to the 4th
                column (MAIRMASS) and an additive detrending to the
                5th and 6th columns (SKY and myval).

                The corresponding model will be:

                model = (transit + C0*SKY + C1*myval)*(F0 + M0*MAIRMASS)

                Where C0, C1, and M0 are fitted detrending
                parameters, F0 is the normalization, and SKY,
                motion, and MAIRMASS are vectors for each data point
                to detrend against.

                The names of the files describing the transits
                *must* adhere to a certain format:
                nYYYYMMDD.filtername.telescope.whateveryouwant. 

                nYYYYMMDD -- The UTC date of mid transit, where YYYY is
                the year, MM is the month, and DD is the day. This
                is only necessary if the data has a single
                transit. This is used to label the transits in the
                output plot.
 
                filtername -- The name of the observed
                filter. If NOCLARET is not set, the filter must be
                among the following list:

                Johnson/Cousins: 'U','B','V','R','I','J','H','K'
                Sloan: 'Sloanu','Sloang','Sloanr','Sloani','Sloanz'
                Kepler: 'Kepler'
                CoRoT: 'CoRoT'
                TESS: 'TESS'
                Spitzer: 'Spit36','Spit45','Spit58','Spit80'
                Stromgren: 'u','b','v','y'

                This is used to define the limb darkening for the
                transit, dilution, and secondary depth
                parameters. 
                
                NOTE: If NOCLARET is set, you may specify anything
                here. If a number where "." is replaced with "_", it
                will be interpreted as a wavelength in microns. If
                TDELTAVS is also set, a plot of depth vs wavelength
                will be created for transmission spectroscopy.

                telescope -- a description of the telescope used for
                the observations. Anything is allowed, but all
                observations observed with the same telescope should
                have the same name. This is used in the output plot
                and color codes the TTV plot.

                whateveryouwant -- any string you want to
                include for it to make sense to you. This is not
                used by the code.

                So a transit taken on UTC 2017-01-27 with MINERVA in
                the V band would be "n20170127.V.MINERVA.dat"

                NOTE 2: The units must be as specified, or the fit
                will be wrong or fail.
                NOTE 3: Other input time stamps will likely not
                break the code, but can introduce errors in the
                reported times of more than a minute. The output
                table will display BJD_TDB but makes no attempt to
                convert input times.  See
                http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010PASP..122..935E
                for an explanation of times
                NOTE 4: If omitted, just the RV data will bit fit

   *** Astrometry is not currently suppported or thoroughly tested. Future updates are likely to change the expected formats ***
  ASTROMPATH  - A string specifying the path to the astrometry data
                file(s). Wildcards are allowed for multiple files
                (e.g., '*.dat'). Each file must have 5 or 8 columns:

                   1) Time (BJD_TDB -- See Eastman et al., 2010)
                   2) RA (ICRS deg)
                   3) DEC (ICRS deg)
                   4) ra uncertainty (mas)
                   5) dec uncertainty (mas)
                   6) X position of observatory (AU from Solar System Barycenter)
                   7) Y position of observatory (AU from Solar System Barycenter)
                   8) Z position of observatory (AU from Solar System Barycenter)

                The filename must adhere to a certain format:
                epoch.location.whateveryouwant                
 
                epoch -- the reference epoch of the
                observations in BJD_TDB (e.g., J2000 is
                2451545).
                location -- the location of the observatory. Only
                "Earth" (geocenter), "Gaia" and "Hipparcos" are
                understood, in which case the observatory position
                (columns 6-8) will be calculated if not supplied.
                whateveryouwant -- any string you want to include
                for it to make sense to you. This is not used by the
                code.

                If supplied, EXOFASTv2 will fit the following
                additional parameters: RA, Dec, PMRA, PMDEC, and
                parallax, plus Omega for each planet. The
                inclination will span the range from 0 to 180 (-1 <
                cosi < 1).

  DTPATH      - The (optional) path to the Doppler Tomography fits
                file(s). If supplied, the code will fit a vsini and
                macro turbulence of the star, as well as a projected
                spin-orbit alignment for each planet. This must be
                used in conjunction with the FITDT, an NPLANETS array
                specifying which planets should have their DT signal
                modeled.

                Each fits file is a 2D array describing all DT
                observations during a single transit with extensions
                describing the axes of the array. The pixel values of
                the 2D array contain the fractional flux decrement at
                a given BJD_TDB (spectrum) and velocity (pixel value
                of the CCF). The first extension should specify the
                BJD_TDB corresponding to each Y pixel and the second
                extension should specify the velocity corresponding
                to each X pixel.

                Such a file can be generated given the 2D array of
                fractional flux decrements (DT), a time array
                (BJD_TDB) and a velocity array (VEL, in km/s) like this:
 
                writefits,'nYYYYMMDD.pname.instrument.resolution.fits',DT
                writefits,'nYYYYMMDD.pname.instrument.resolution.fits',BJD_TDB, /append
                writefits,'nYYYYMMDD.pname.instrument.resolution.fits',VEL, /append

                The names of these files *must* adhere to a certain format:
                nYYYYMMDD.pname.instrument.resolution.whateveryouwant.fits 

                nYYYYMMDD -- The UTC date of mid transit. This is
                used to label the transits in the output plot.
 
                pname -- The name of the planet, including the
                         letter for the planet order (e.g., KELT-24b)

                instrument -- the name of the instrument used for
                the observations. Anything is allowed, but all
                observations observed with the same telescope should
                have the same name. This is used in the labels.

                resolution -- The R value of the instrument. This is
                required to accurately model the DT signal and must
                be correct.

                whateveryouwant - any string you want to include (or
                nothing) for it to make sense to you (e.g, target
                name). This is not used by the code.

                So a transit taken on UTC 2017-01-27 with the TRES
                spectrograph (R=44000) would be called
                "n20170127.TRES.44000.fits"
 
                NOTE 0: When supplied this way, the DT data does not
                constrain vsini. A gaussian prior must be given in
                the prior file.

                NOTE 1: NAXIS1 must equal the number of velocities and
                NAXIS2 must equal the number of times.

                NOTE 2: Not using BJD_TDB time stamps will likely
                not break the code, but can introduce errors in the
                reported times of more than a minute or cause
                internal inconsistencies if different data sets use
                different timestamps. The output table will display
                BJD_TDB but makes no attempt to convert or reconcile
                input times between data sets.

                See
                http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010PASP..122..935E 
                for an explanation of times

                NOTE 3: If DTPATH is omitted, Doppler Tomography is
                not included in the global fit

 SED MODEL INPUTS:
  FLUXFILE    - An ASCII file with each line containing 3-5 white
                space delimited columns: 

                FILTER MAG UNCERTAINTY CATALOG_UNCERTAINTY STARNDX

                FILTER: The filter name. See
                $EXOFAST_PATH/sed/mist/filternames2.txt for
                a complete list of allowed filters.

                MAG: The apparent magnitude in the specified filter

                UNCERTAINTY: The uncertainty in the apparent magnitude

                CATALOG_UNCERTAINTY: Often catalog errors ignore
                systematic error. This is the catalog error for 
                reference, but is ignored. 

                STARNDX: The index of the star(s) this magnitude
                corresponds to. Multiple stars can be specified as a
                comma delimited list (e.g., "0,1"). Differential
                magnitudes can be specified with a "-" (e.g.,
                "2-0,1"). This is ignored when the FLUXFILE model.

                NOTE: a parallax prior should be specified or the SED
                model will simply determine a photometric parallax.

                $EXOFAST_PATH/mkticsed.pro will automatically
                generate this file using queryVizier to query trusted
                catalogs with appropriate systematic error floors
                based on the object's name or coordinates. Exercise
                caution that the correct object was selected for each
                catalog.
 
                The FLUXFILE SED model assumes top hat filter
                profiles to sum NEXTGEN stellar atmospheres. It does
                not support Gaia bands, multiple stars, differential
                photometry, or spectrophotometry. It is no longer
                recommended for general use but is left for
                comparison.

  MISTSEDFILE - Same as FLUXFILE, but uses the MIST bolometric
                correction tables based on the C3K atmospheric
                grids. Supports multiple stars and differential
                photometry, and a much wider range of filters, but
                not spectrophotometry.

  SEDFILE     - Same as FLUXFILE, but uses detailed filter profiles
                to determine the model flux. The user can supply
                their own filter profiles or generate any from SVO
                using
                $EXOFAST_PATH/sed/filtercurves/getfilter.pro. This
                model supports multiple stars, differential
                photometry, and spectrophotometry.

  SPECPHOTPATH- The path to spectrophotometry files. Can only be used
                in conjunction with the SEDFILE SED model.

  NOAVPRIOR   - By default, when multiple stars are fit, the
                exinction (AV) is assumed to be a monotonically
                increasing function of distance. Set this keyword to
                allow any AV regardless of distance.
 
  FBOLSEDFLOOR- The SED model's constraint on the bolometric flux is
                typically dominated by systematic uncertainty. This
                sets that floor. Default is 0.024 (2.4%). See
                Tayar+2022.

  TEFFSEDFLOOR- The SED model's constraint on the effective
                temperature is typically dominated by systematic
                uncertainty. This sets that floor. Default is 0.02
                (2.0%). See Tayar+2022.

  FEHSEDFLOOR - The SED model's constraint on the metalicity
                occasionally exceeds the systematic uncertainty. This
                sets that floor. Default is none. If set, a new
                FEHSED is fit.

  ONED        - For the FLUXFILE and SEDFILE models, the reddened
                NEXTGEN atmospheres are trilinearly interpolated in
                3D in Teff, logg, and [Fe/H]. If set, the nearest
                gridpoints in logg and [Fe/H] are used (typically
                ~0.5 dex), and the interpolation is only done in
                Teff. Use of this keyword is not recommended.
 
 EVOLUTIONARY MODEL INPUTS:

  NOMIST     - An NSTARS boolean array specifying not to use the MIST
               evolutionary tracks see
               http://waps.cfa.harvard.edu/MIST/ And please cite
               http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJS..222....8D
               http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...823..102C

  PARSEC     - An NSTARS boolean array specifying to use the PARSEC
               evolutionary tracks. This should
               be accompanied by the NOMIST keyword (but is not
               enforced).

  YY         - An NSTARS boolean array specifying to use the YY
               evolutionary tracks see
               http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001ApJS..136..417Y to
               constrain the mass/radius of the star. YY should not
               be used for low-mass stars (~< 0.5 msun). This should
               be accompanied by the NOMIST keyword (but is not
               enforced).

  TORRES     - An NSTARS boolean array specifying to use the Torres
               relations to constrain the mass and radius of the
               star. This may be useful to investigate potential
               systematics and should be accompanied by the NOMIST
               keyword (but is not enforced). The Torres relations
               are not applicable for low mass (< 0.6 msun) stars.

  MANNRAD    - An NSTARS boolean array specifying to use the Mann+
               2015 Ks-Rstar relations to constrain the radius of the
               star. A prior on the apparent Ks band magnitude (e.g.,
               from 2MASS) and parallax should be given, and should
               be accompanied by the NOMIST keyword. The Mann
               relations are not applicable to high mass (> 0.7 msun)
               stars. When the transit-based constraint on rhostar
               exceeds ~5%, use of this relation is not recommended.

  MANNMASS   - An NSTARS boolean array specifying to use the Mann+
               2019 Ks-Mstar relations to constrain the mass of the
               star. A prior on the apparent Ks-band magnitude (e.g.,
               from 2MASS) and parallax should be given, and should
               be accompanied by the NOMIST keyword. The Mann
               relations are not applicable to high mass (> 0.7 msun)
               stars.

  TEFFEMFLOOR- When using MIST, PARSEC, or YY, the evolutionary
               model's constraint on the effective temperature is
               typically dominated by systematic uncertainty. This
               sets that floor. The default is a function of stellar
               mass and evolutionary model. See Tayar+2022.

  FEHEMFLOOR - When using MIST, PARSEC, or YY, the evolutionary
               model's constraint on the metallicity is typically
               dominated by systematic uncertainty. This sets that
               floor. Default is 0.08 dex.

  RSTAREMFLOOR
            - When using MIST, PARSEC, or YY, the evolutionary
              model's constraint on the stellar radius is typically
              dominated by systematic uncertainty. This sets that
              floor. The default is a function of stellar mass and
              evolutionary model. See Tayar+2022.

  AGEEMFLOOR- The evolutionary model's constraint on the stellar age
              is typically dominated by systematic uncertainty
              (maybe?). This sets that floor. The default is a
              function of stellar mass and evolutionary model.

 BEER MODEL INPUTS:

  FITTHERMAL- An NTRANSITS boolean array specifying which transits to
              fit thermal emission for. This is what you want to set
              to model an isolated secondary eclipse. When set, the
              transit will be modeled with a baseline of 1 between t2
              and t3 of the secondary eclipse and 1 + thermal
              emission (in PPM) out of eclipse.

              NOTE: earlier versions of this array specified the band
              name and all similar bands were linked together. This
              functionality can be recreated by linking the THERMAL
              parameters in the prior file for common bands.

  FITELLIP  - A string array specifying which bands to fit an
              ellipsoidal variation amplitude for. Note: this does
              *not* feedback into the global model through F&M 2011,
              eq 2
              NOTE: this should be (has been?) converted like FITTHERMAL

  FITREFLECT- A string array specifying which bands to fit reflected
              light for. Set this along with thermal if you're
              fitting a full phase curve. It will be modeled as a
              sinusoid with the orbital period, a minimum at the
              primary transit, and a fitted amplitude (in PPM).

  FITPHASE  - An NPLANETS boolean array that specifies if a phase
              shift to the sinusoidal reflection signal should be
              fit. This appears to be broken. Use with caution.

  FITBEAM   - An NPLANETS boolean array that specifies which planets
              to model a doppler beaming signal. If this beaming
              amplitude is fit directly, it will *not* constrain the
              planetary mass (set DERIVEBEAM instead).

  DERIVEBEAM- An NPLANET boolean array that specifies which planets
              to model a doppler beaming signal. If this beaming
              amplitude is derived (from K), it will constrain the
              planetary mass through Faigler & Mazeh, 2011, eq 1 (set
              FITBEAM instead to model the beaming but break this
              connection).

 STAR INPUTS:

  NSTARS    - The number of stars to model. Default=1. Must be larger
              than 0.
 
  STARNDX   - An NPLANETS long array that specifies the index of the
              star each planet orbits. The default is 0 for all.
 
  SEDDEBLEND- An NTRANSITSxNSTARS boolean array specifying which
              transits are blended with which stars. These will
              automatically be deblended according to the SED models
              of all stars specified here, assuming an error of 10%.
              NOTE: TESS lightcurves from SPOC are already deblended
              with known companions (in TICv8.1). They can be
              undeblended with the -u option to
              $EXOFAST_PATH/getdata.py.

  FITDILUTE -A string array specifying which bands to fit a dilution
             term for. It will fit the fractional contribution from
             the companion. This should be set if the star is blended
             with a neighbor and you expect color-dependent depth
             variations in the transit or photocenter variations in
             the astrometry.

             If you just have the flux ratio, X, solve this system of
             equations for Flux_companion:
         
             Flux_companion/Flux_primary = X
             Flux_companion + Flux_primary = 1
             Flux_companion = X/(X+1)

             Note 1: For transits, this is likely to be degenerate
             with F0 (transit normalization). You probably need to
             apply a prior (DILUTE_#, where # corresponds to the band
             index) from some external information to constrain it
             (e.g., an SED fit). 
 
             Note 2: For astrometry, this is degenerate with the
             semi-major axis/mass. You must supply a prior on the
             dilution (e.g., from AO) in at least one band if one of
             those is not independently determined.

             Note 3: This dilution does not impact the SED fit. The
             SED broadband photometry is assumed to be for the
             single, primary component.

 PLANET INPUTS:

  NPLANETS  - The number of planets you wish to fit to the
              data. Default is 1. If 0 is set, it will just fit the
              star.

  FITTRAN   - An NPLANETS boolean array that specifies which planets
              should be fit with a transit model.  If TRANPATH is
              specified, default is bytarr(nplanets) + 1B.  If
              TRANPATH is not specified, default is bytarr(nplanets).
              At least one of FITRV and FITTRAN should be true for
              each planet

  FITRV     - An NPLANETS boolean array that specifies which planets
              should be fit with an RV model.  If RVPATH is
              specified, default is bytarr(nplanets) + 1B.  If RVPATH
              is not specified, default is bytarr(nplanets).  At
              least one of FITRV and FITTRAN should be true for each
              planet

  ROSSITER  - An NPLANETS boolean array that specifies which planets
              should fit the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect to the RV
              data using the Ohta approximation.  See
              https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ApJ...622.1118O/abstract
              If a run was dedicated to RM, it should be separated
              into its own RV file to fit a different zero point and
              jitter parameter to it.  Default is bytarr(nplanets)

  FITDT    - An NPLANETS boolean array that specifies which planets
             should be fit using a Doppler Tomography model.  Default
             is bytarr(nplanets)

  CIRCULAR - An NPLANETS boolean array that specifies which planets
             should be fixed to be circular (1) or left with
             eccentricity free (0). Default is all eccentric planets
             bytarr(nplanets)

  TIDES    - If set, when (1-Rstar/a-rp/a) < e < (1-3*Rstar/a), we
             set the eccentricity to zero, presuming that the tidal
             circularization timescale is much much smaller than the
             age of the system.

  ALLOWORBITCROSSING
           - By default, models that have projected orbits within
             each others' hill spheres are rejected, presuming
             they are unstable and constraining eccentricity. This
             may be too strict when mutual inclinations are
             significant (it would exclude Pluto/Neptune). Set this
             keyword to disable this constraint and allow orbits to
             cross one another.

  CHEN     - An NPLANETS boolean array that specifies which planets
             should have the Chen & Kipping, 2017 mass-radius
             relation applied. By default CHEN = FITRV xor
             FITTRAN. That is, only apply the mass-radius prior when
             RV is not fit (to derive the planet mass) or when a
             transit is not fit (to derive the planet radius). If the
             defaults have been overridden and FITRV and CHEN are
             both false for a given planet, the RV semi-amplitude
             (planet mass) and all derived parameters will not be
             quoted. Multi-planet systems will be constrained not to
             cross orbits, but the Hill Sphere will be set to zero.
             If FITTRAN and CHEN are both false for a given planet,
             the planetary radius and all derived parameters will not
             be quoted.

  I180     - An NPLANETS boolean array specifying which planets'
             inclination should be allowed to be between 0 and 180
             instead of the default of 0 to 90. Note that a typical
             transiting planet has a perfect degeneracy between i and
             180-i which is likely to cause convergence
             problems. Additional information (e.g., from astrometry
             or mutual eclipses) must be used for this keyword to
             have the desired impact. Even in the case of mutual
             eclipses (which is currently not supported), at least
             one planet must be arbitrarily constrained from 0 to 90.

 RV INPUTS

  FITSLOPE - If set, it will fit a linear trend to the RV data.

  FITQUAD  - If set, it will fit a quadratic trend to the RV
             data. FITSLOPE is automatically set if FITQUAD is set.

  RVEPOCH  - This is the BJD_TDB of a reference epoch for RV linear
             and quadratic trends. Default is the midpoint of all RV
             observations.

             RV = planet + gamma + SLOPE*(t-RVEPOCH) + QUAD*(t-RVEPOCH)^2
 
 TRANSIT INPUTS

  NOCLARET - An NTRANSITFILES boolean array that, if set, will ignore
             the Claret & Bloeman limb darkening tables and just fit
             the limb darkening. This should be specified for
             low-mass stars where these tables are unreliable or for
             high SNR transits where they can constrain the LD
             directly.

  TTVS     - An NTRANSITFILESxNPLANETS boolean array, specifying which
             transit files should have a timing offset applied
             corresponding to which planets. 
             NOTE: if the same transit applies to more than one
             planet, the same offset will be applied to both. Such
             transits should probably be removed from the analysis.

  TIVS     - An NTRANSITFILESxNPLANETS boolean array, specifying which
             transit files should have an inclination offset applied
             corresponding to which planets.  
             NOTE: if the same transit applies to more than one
             planet, the same offset will be applied to both. Such
             transits should probably be removed from the analysis.

  TDELTAVS - An NTRANSITFILESxNPLANETS boolean array, specifying which
             transit files should have a depth offset applied
             corresponding to which planets.  NOTE: if the same
             transit applies to more than one planet, the same offset
             will be applied to both. Such transits should probably
             be removed from the analysis.

  LONGCADENCE
           - An NTRANSITFILES boolean array, which sets/overwrites
             EXPTIME=29.425 and NINTERP=10 to handle Kepler long
             cadence data. This is measurably different from TESS
             long cadence data (EXPTIME=30, NINTERP=10).
 
  EXPTIME  - An NTRANSITFILES array of exposure times, in minutes,
             for each transit. The model data point will be an
             average of NINTERP samples over a duration of EXPTIME
             minutes centered on the input time. Generally, a
             sampling at least every 3 minutes is recommended. For a
             dicussion on binning, see:
             http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.408.1758K

  NINTERP  - An NTRANSITFILES long array for the number of points to
             average throughout the EXPTIME. If set, the each model
             data point will be an average of NINTERP samples over a
             duration of EXPTIME minutes centered on the input
             time. Generally, a sampling at least every 3 minutes is
             recommended.

  REJECTFLATMODEL
           - An NTRANSITFILES byte array specifying which transits
             must have a signal. If model without a signal is
             generated and REJECTFLATMODEL==1B, the model will be
             rejected a priori. If a flat model is accepted when a
             transit is expected, there is an infinite volume of
             parameter space with equal likelihood, which breaks the
             Markov condition, and it will never converge. Note the
             default allows flat models because 1) the user may wish
             to model out of transit constraints on the ephemeris and
             2) rejecting flat models a priori may give the user an
             undue confidence in the signficance of the signal. This
             is likely required for low SNR transits or when using
             parallel tempering (see NTEMP and TF).

 NOPRIMARY - An NPLANETS byte array specifying which planets are
             allowed to not have a primary transit. Normally, b>1+p
             models are rejected because the transit fit is
             unconstrained and poorly behaved, but in the rare cases
             a planet only has a secondary and not a primary, this is
             required. You probably also want to specify
             REQUIRESECONDARY=NOPRIMARY.

 REQUIRESECONDARY - 
             An NPLANETS byte array specifying which planets are
             required to have a secondary eclipse. Models with bs>1+p
             will be rejected. When fitting a secondary, this could
             bias non-significant detections. When only fitting a
             secondary, this may be required to keep the fit
             reasonably bounded.

  FITSPLINE- An NTRANSITFILES byte array specifying which transits
             should be flatted with Andrew Vanderburg's
             keplerspline. This should only be used for long baseline
             data like Kepler, K2, or TESS.

  SPLINESPACE
           - An NTRANSITFILES array specifying the knot spacing
             between adjacent points in the spline, in days. To be
             used in conjunction with FITSPLINE. Default is 0.75
             days. This spacing should be large compared to the
             transit duration (>~ 3x), or there is significant risk
             of introducing a strong covariance between the spline
             and the transit parameters, biasing the inferred values,
             inflating the uncertainties, and increasing convergence
             times. It should be short compared to the variability
             you wish to remove.

  FITRAMP  - An NTRANSITFILES byte array specifying which transits
             should be fit with an exponential ramp (common for JWST
             and Spitzer LCs). When set, the corresponding lightcurve
             will be multiplied by 1+A*exp((time[0]-time)/tau), where
             A and tau (unique to each LC) are fitted parameters
             reported alongside other transit parameters and time is
             the user-supplied time from the transit file. A is
             typically negative.

  FITWAVELET
           - An NTRANSITFILES array specifying which to fit Carter's
             wavelet error to handle correlated errors. See
             https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...704...51C/abstract

 REPARAMETERIZATION INPUTS:

  FITLOGMP - By default, planet mass is parameterized as MP. Set this
             keyword to parameterize it as LOGMP. This may impose a
             more realistic prior, but is problematic for low SNR RVs
             where the small-planet volume is infinite. It also
             excludes negative masses which biases the mass high.

  NOVCVE   - When only transits are fit, eccentricity is
             parameterized as VCVE. Set this to keep the usual
             sqrt(e)cos(omega) sqrt(e)sin(omega) parameterization.

  NOCHORD  - When only transits are fit, cosi is parameterized as
             chord. Set this to keep cosi.

  FITSIGN  - When only transits are fit, e is parameterized as VCVE,
             but solving for e requires a quadratic. By default, a
             sign is fit to choose the solution. Set this to zeros to
             use the degenerate parameter L to determine the sign. 
             See Eastman, 2023 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14410)
 
  FITTT    - TT is the minimum projected separation, the intuitive
             defintion of the transit time, but one that must be
             numerically computed. By default, we fit for the time of
             conjunction, TC. For eccentric, inclined orbits, this
             can introduce significant non-linear covariances and it
             may be faster to take the hit to derive TT.

  EARTH    - If set, the output units of Mp and Rp are in Earth
             units, not Jupiter units.

 PLOTTING INPUTS
  TRANSITRANGE
           - A six element array that defines the
             [XMIN,XMAX,YMIN,YMAX,O-C_YMIN,O-CYMAX] plotting limits
             for the transit figure. Any value set to !values.d_nan
             will use the default value. This allows the user a level
             of customization of the plot, but was designed to be
             used in conjunction with mkfitgif to ensure the plot
             ranges are constant throughout the fit.

  RVRANGE
           - A six element array that defines the
             [XMIN,XMAX,YMIN,YMAX,O-C_YMIN,O-CYMAX] plotting limits
             for the RV figure. Any value set to !values.d_nan will
             use the default value. This allows the user a level of
             customization of the plot, but was designed to be used
             in conjunction with mkfitgif to ensure the plot ranges
             are constant throughout the fit.

  SEDRANGE
           - A six element array that defines the
             [XMIN,XMAX,YMIN,YMAX,O-C_YMIN,O-CYMAX] plotting limits
             for the SED figure. Any value set to !values.d_nan will
             use the default value. This allows the user a level of
             customization of the plot, but was designed to be used
             in conjunction with mkfitgif to ensure the plot ranges
             are constant throughout the fit.

  EMRANGE
           - A four element array that defines the
             [XMIN,XMAX,YMIN,YMAX] plotting limits of the
             evolutionary model (MIST, PARSEC, YY) figure. Any value
             set to !values.d_nan will use the default value. This
             allows the user a level of customization of the plot,
             but was designed to be used in conjunction with mkfitgif
             to ensure the plot ranges are constant throughout the
             fit.

 DEBUGGING INPUTS
  DEBUG    - When this keyword is set, plots will be displayed to the
             screen for each model. This is intended to help identify
             problematic parameters that need additional constraints,
             though it's often too slow to be helpful. Generally,
             VERBOSE serves this purpose better. It can also
             help build intuition about how the different stages of
             EXOFASTv2 work. 

  VERBOSE  - When this keyword is set, more detailed information is
             printed to the screen and logfile at each step,
             including specific reasons why a model was rejected
             (which parameters were out of bounds), the values of all
             fitted parameters, and the chi^2 components for each
             fit. This is often very helpful in identifying
             problematic parameters that need additional constraints.

  DELAY    - If set, the chi^2 function runs a dummy for loop to
             count to the DELAY value specified, arbitrarily
             inflating the runtime of the chi^2 computation. This is
             designed to benchmark the performance of multi-threading
             and is not intended for general use.

 MCMC INPUTS:
  
  NOTE: The MCMC portion of the fit will automatically stop when one
  of the following conditions are met:

           GR < MAXGR and TZ > MINTZ at 5 consecutive evaluations
               (and DONTSTOP is not set)
           STEPS > MAXSTEPS
           TIME > MAXTIME
           !STOPNOW=1

  MAXSTEPS - The maximum number of steps to take in the MCMC
             chain. Note that a 32-bit installation of IDL cannot
             allocate more than 260 million double-precision numbers,
             and redundant copies of each parameter are
             required. Even a 64-bit installation may require very
             slow disk swapping. A very large number for MAXSTEPS
             will cause memory management problems. The default
             chooses the number that will use 1 GB of RAM, and larger
             values are strongly discouraged (increase NTHIN instead
             if the chains are not well-mixed). Decrease MAXSTEPS for
             preliminary runs.

             NOTE1: If the MCMC chains run to MAXSTEPS, doubling this
             value will double the runtime. Short test runs
             (MAXSTEPS=100) are strongly encouraged before running
             week-long fits.

  NTHIN    - If set, only every NTHINth element will be kept. High
             values typically don't degrade the resultant fit because
             there is the correlation length between adjacent steps
             is long. This has the advantage of improved memory
             management, reduced storage, and faster generation of
             the final plots. Default is roughly set to pass the
             mixing criteria, but this is highly uncertain. Revising
             this parameter based on preliminary fits is strongly
             encouraged.

             NOTE: Only saved links in the chain count toward
             MAXSTEPS, so if the MCMC chains run to MAXSTEPS,
             doubling this value will double the runtime.

  MAXTIME  - The maximum runtime for the DEMC portion of the code, in
             seconds. If set, the fit will begin wrapping up after
             MAXTIME seconds. This is intended for non-interactive
             use with a time constraint (e.g., running on a super
             computer). Note this only applies to the MCMC portion of
             the code, and it finishes the loops over NTEMPS and
             NTHIN before it will check the time. The time AMOEBA
             takes or the time to synthesize the results is not
             counted, therefore, it would be wise to set this at
             least 1800 seconds (30 minutes) less than any hard
             limit.

  MAXGR    - The maximum Gelman Rubin statistic that is considered
             well-mixed (default=1.01). 

  MINTZ    - The minimum number of independent draws that is
             considered well-mixed (default=1000). The fit will
             automatically stop when GR < MAXGR and TZ > MINTZ at 5
             consecutive evaluations.

  DONTSTOP - A keyword that, when set, the fit will take MAXSTEPS
             steps regardless of GR and TZ statistics. This is
             statistically unnecessary, but sometimes useful to
             generate prettier output plots (smoother contours and
             PDFs).

  !STOPNOW - This global keyword can be set during a fit to stop a
             fit early and have it summarize the results. This is
             helpful for prelimary or problematic runs. During a run
             that you want to stop, type:

                 control + c 
                 !stopnow=1 
                 .con

             NOTE: This is not possible with license-free use.

  NTEMPS   - This enables parallel tempering and sets the number of
             chains to run at different temperatures, uniformly
             distributed between 1 and TF. The more temperatures, the
             easier it is to make swaps between temperatures, but the
             longer it can take. The default is 1 (no parallel
             tempering). 8 is a good value, but more may be required
             for high dimensional fits. Note that only the T=1 chain
             is kept by default. Parallel tempering is better at
             finding the global minimum in a rough likelihood surface
             and sampling widely spaced, multi-modal distributions
             (often the case for MIST models). Nominally, NTEMPS more
             steps are taken, requiring NTEMPS times longer to
             run. However, many models are rejected as out of bounds,
             and it may lead to better mixing and therefore faster
             convergence, so the effect on runtime is system
             dependent and not obvious. You are strongly encouraged
             to use NTEMPS=8 for initial fits in order to optimize
             the starting location of the next fit.

  TF       - The temperature of the hottest chain, when NTEMPS >
             1. The higher the temperature, the more parameter space
             it will probe, but the chains will be less likely to
             swap. Default is 200, which can robustly find minima
             separated by 50 sigma. A value of 1 will result in no
             temperature difference between chains.

  KEEPHOT  - By default, the hot chains (and their corresponding
             chi^2) from parallel tempering (see NTEMPS and TF) are
             dynamically discarded to save memory. If this keyword is
             set and NTEMPS > 1, the steps from the hot chains
             (HOTPARS) and the corresponding chi2 (HOTCHI2) will be
             stored in memory during the fit and saved in the output
             IDL file. This is not useful to determine the posterior,
             and should only be used for debugging (e.g., determining
             the extent of parameter space explored), as it
             significantly increases the memory footprint.

  RANDOMFUNC
           - A string specifying the name of the random number
             generator to use. This generator must be able to return
             1,2 or 3 dimensional uniform or normal random
             deviates. 
             
             When using IDL versions < v8.2, IDL's built-in RANDOMU
             is based on numerical recipe's RAN1, and is not good
             enough for MCMC. In this case, we use 'EXOFAST_RANDOM'
             (which is based on Numerical Recipe's RAN3 and is slow
             but robust).

             When using IDL versions >= v8.2, we use IDL's
             built-in RANDOMU.

  SEED     - The seed to the random number generator used for the
             MCMC fits. Be sure not to mix seeds from different
             generators. The default is -systime(/seconds). This is
             helpful if the user wishes to generate the exact same
             sequence of "random" numbers, the proposed steps will
             quickly diverge if anything else is changed, but this
             can be particularly useful make bugs reproducible.

  STRETCH  - By default, EXOFASTv2 uses a differential evolution
             method to generate the next proposed set of
             parameters. Set this keyword to use the Affine Invariant
             "stretch" step instead (popularized by emcee). In our
             tests, STRETCH is inferior to DEMC and is not generally
             recommended.

  NTHREADS - The number of threads to use during the MCMC portion of
             the fit. For short preliminary runs, often the overhead
             of initializing the threads exceeds its benefit. But for
             longer runs, especially for complex models (that take >~
             0.005 seconds), the scaling is near perfect up to the
             number of cores on your machine (4 cores => NTHREAD=4 =>
             4x faster). The default is !CPU.HW_NCPU, meaning it will
             use all available cores on your machine for a dramatic
             speed up. For shared computers/servers, this is likely
             an inappropriate use and counterproductive for you
             (requesting more CPU power than is available adds
             overhead without benefit).

 GENERAL INPUTS:

  SKIPTT   - A keyword that skips the expensive numerical computation
             of TT for each step at the end. This is rarely useful
             unless doing TTVs.

  USERNOTE - A string that is printed to the top of the log file,
             intended to help the user keep track of fits. 

  MKSUMMARYPG
           - A keyword that generates a quick look summary page of
             all MCMC plots and chain outputs at the end of the
             run. This spawns several commands to the terminal,
             including gs, ps2pdf, grep, and convert, so
             probably only works for a fraction of linux users, no
             windows users, and maybe some mac users.

  NOCOVAR  - A keyword that skips the generation of the covariance
             corner plot. This is somewhat expensive, large, and ugly for
             high dimensional fits. GDL users cannot generate this
             anyway. Users interested in better corner plots should
             look at $EXOFAST_PATH/remake_corner.pro.

  PLOTONLY - Will stop after generating START models. Useful for
             setting up an initial fit.

  BESTONLY - Will stop after generating AMOEBA models. Useful for
             setting up an initial fit.

  BADSTART - A return value that is true if the starting model was
             bad. Useful to check for/handle failures during batch
             fits.
  
 OUTPUTS:

   Each of the output files will be preceeded by PREFIX (defined
   above).

   mcmc.idl   - An IDL save file that contains the stellar structure
                with the full chains for each parameter, including
                derived parameters, the chi2 at each link, and the
                index of the burn-in period, called MCMCSS (MCMC
                stellar structure).
   chain.ps   - A postscript plot of each parameter as a function of
                chain link, 8 to a page. Each color is a separate
                chain.
   pdf.ps     - A postscript plot of each posterior distribution
                function, 8 to a page. Each color is a separate
                chain. The thick black line is the average of all
                chains.
   covar.ps   - A postscript plot of the covariances between each
                fitted parameter in a corner plot.
   median.tex - The LaTeX source code for a deluxe table of the
                median values and 68% confidence interval, rounded to
                two sig figs in the uncertainty.
   median.csv - A machine readable table of the median values and 68%
                confidence interval, rounded to two sig figs in the
                uncertainty.
   log        - A file containing everything printed to screen during
                the fit for later review.
   
   Each of the following outputs are created at 3 distinct phases in
   the fit. 

   1) Files preceeded with "start." are the starting values of the
   fit. Often times it is necessary to tweak these by hand until the
   starting values are a pretty good match to the data.

   2) Files preceeded with "amoeba." are the models after the amoeba
   minimization is complete. If this model is not a good fit to the
   data, the fit is likely to fail and you should refine your
   starting values, priors, and constraints. At a minimum, the MCMC
   is likely to take significantly longer to converge if this is not
   a good fit.

   3) Files preceeded with "mcmc." are the final plots meant for
   publication. They represent the best fit among all links of all
   chains.

   transit.ps - A multi-page postscript plot of the transit
                model. The first page has each transit (file) stacked
                on the same plot, offset by a constant. Subsequent
                pages are the detrended, phase-folded transits for
                each planet.
   rv.ps      - A multi-page postscript plot of the RV model. The
                first page is the unphased model with gamma and any
                fitted linear or quadratic terms subtracted from both
                the data and model. If more than one instrument is
                used, a legend is produced in the corner. Subsequent
                pages are each planet, phased to its period, with all
                other planets, gamma, and any fitted linear and
                quadratic terms subtracted.
   mist.eps   - A plot of the star with its MIST isochrone
                overplotted. The black point is the best-fit value,
                the red point is the corresponding model value. Only
                generated if the /NOMIST keyword is not set.
   yy.eps     - A plot of the star with its YY isochrone
                overplotted. The black point is the best-fit value,
                the red point is the corresponding model value. Only
                generated if the /YY keyword is not set.
   sed.eps    - A plot of the broadband photometry and best fit
                SED. Only generated if FLUXFILE is given.
 
  We recognize that in many cases, the outputs plots are not
  publication quality. The following text outputs are intended to
  allow the user to generate their own, more complicated or
  customized plots without having to recreate the model or
  detrending. These files are placed in a modelfiles subdirectory within
  the output directory.

  residuals.telescope_[i].txt --
      A text file containing the residuals to the best-fit model RV
      for the ith telescope.
   model.telescope_[i].txt --
      A text file containing the best-fit model (with gamma, slope,
      and quad subtracted) RVs for each time given for telescope.
      One for each telescope is generated.
   model.transit_[i].txt - 
      The model of the ith transit at each input data point,
      including detrending.
   residuals.transit_[i].txt -- 
      The residuals of the ith transit file at each data point.
   detrendedmodel.transit_[i].planet_[j].txt -- 
      The detrended model of the ith transit of the jth planet minus
      1 at each input data point. Sum all transit[i].planet_*.txt and add
      one for the combined model. Useful for separating overlapping
      transits.
   prettymodel.transit_[i].planet_[j].txt -- 
      Same as detrendedmodel.transit_[i].planet_[j].txt, but sampled
      every minute from the first to the last data point. This is
      intended to make a pretty model plot if there are gaps in the
      data.

   NOTE 1: The detrended data can by derived by adding the residuals
      to the detrended model

   NOTE 2: To extract a single page out of a multi-page PS file, use:

         psselect -p# input.ps output.ps 

      where # is the (1-indexed) page number to extract.

 COMMON BLOCKS:
   CHI2_BLOCK:
     SS      - A structure that describes the entire stellar system

 NAME:
	EXOFAST_AMOEBA

 PURPOSE:
	Multidimensional minimization of a function FUNC(X), where
	X is an N-dimensional vector, using the downhill simplex
	method of Nelder and Mead, 1965, Computer Journal, Vol 7, pp 308-313.

	This routine is based on the AMOEBA routine, Numerical
	Recipes in C: The Art of Scientific Computing (Second Edition), Page
	411, and is used by permission.

       This is a debugged version of IDL's built-in AMOEBA, changing:
       fac1 = (1.0 - fac) / n_elements(psum)
       to 
       fac1 = (1.d0 - fac) / n_elements(psum)

 CATEGORY:
	Function minimization/maximization. Simplex method.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	Result = EXOFAST_AMOEBA(Ftol, ....)
 INPUTS:
    FTOL:  the fractional tolerance to be achieved in the function
	value.  e.g. the fractional decrease in the function value in the
	terminating step.  This should never be less than the
	machine's single or double precision.
 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
    FUNCTION_NAME: a string containing the name of the function to
	be minimized.  If omitted, the function FUNC is minimized.
	This function must accept an Ndim vector as its only parameter and
	return a scalar single or double precision floating point value as its
	result. 
    FUNCTION_VALUE: (output) on exit, an Ndim+1 element vector
	containing the function values at the simplex points.  The first
	element contains the function minimum. 
    NCALLS: (output) the of times the function was evaluated. 
    NMAX: the maximum number of function evaluations allowed
	before terminating.  Default = 5000.
    P0: Initial starting point, an Ndim element vector.  The starting
	point must be specified using either the keyword SIMPLEX, or P0 and
	SCALE.  P0 may be either single or double precision floating.
	For example, in a 3-dimensional problem, if the initial guess
	is the point [0,0,0], and it is known that the function's
	minimum value occurs in the interval: -10 <
	X(0) < 10, -100 < X(1) < 100, -200 < X(2) < 200, specify: P0=[0,0,0],
	SCALE=[10, 100, 200]. 
    SCALE: a scalar or Ndim element vector contaiing the problem's
	characteristic length scale for each dimension.
	SCALE is used with P0 to form an initial (Ndim+1) point simplex.
	If all dimensions have the same	scale, specify a scalar.
    SIMPLEX: (output and/or optional input) On input, if P0 and SCALE
	are not set, SIMPLEX contains the Ndim+1 vertices, each of
	Ndim elements, of starting simplex, in either single or double
	precision floating point, in an (Ndim, Ndim+1) array. On output,
	SIMPLEX contains the simplex, of dimensions (Ndim, Ndim+1), enclosing
	the function minimum.  The first point, Simplex(*,0), corresponds to
	the function's minimum.

 OUTPUTS:
   Result: If the minimum is found, an Ndim vector, corresponding to
	the Function's minimum value is returned.  If a function minimum
	within the given tolerance, is NOT found in the given number of
	evaluations, a scalar value of -1 is returned.

 COMMON BLOCKS:
	None.

 SIDE EFFECTS:
	None.

 PROCEDURE:
	This procedure implements the Simplex method, described in
	Numerical Recipes, Section 10.4.  See also the POWELL procedure.

	Advantages:  requires only function evaluations, not
	derivatives, may be more reliable than the POWELL method.
	Disadvantages: not as efficient as Powell's method, and usually
	requires more function evaluations.

	Results are performed in the mode (single or double precision)
	returned by the user-supplied function.  The mode of the inputs P0,
	SCALE, or SIMPLEX, should match that returned by the function. The
	mode of the input vector supplied to the user-written function, is
	determined by P0, SCALE, or SIMPLEX.

 EXAMPLE:
	Use Amoeba to find the slope and intercept of a straight line fitting
	a given set of points minimizing the maximum error:

	The function to be minimized returns the maximum error,
	given p(0) = intercept, and p(1) = slope:
 FUNCTION FUNC, p
 COMMON FUNC_XY, x, y
 RETURN, MAX(ABS(y - (p(0) + p(1) * x)))
 END

	Put the data points into a common block so they are accessible to the
	function: 
 COMMON FUNC_XY, x, y
	Define the data points:
   x = findgen(17)*5
   y = [ 12.0,  24.3,  39.6,  51.0,  66.5,  78.4,  92.7, 107.8, 120.0, $
        135.5, 147.5, 161.0, 175.4, 187.4, 202.5, 215.4, 229.9]

	Call the function.  Fractional tolerance = 1 part in 10^5, 
	Initial guess = [0,0], and the minimum should be found within
	a distance of 100 of that point: 
   r = EXOFAST_AMOEBA(1.0e-5, SCALE=1.0e2, P0 = [0, 0], FUNCTION_VALUE=fval)

	Check for convergence:
   if n_elements(r) eq 1 then message,'AMOEBA failed to converge'
	Print results.
   print, 'Intercept, Slope:', r, 'Function value (max error): ', fval(0)
Intercept, Slope:      11.4100      2.72800
Function value:       1.33000

 NAME:
   EXOFAST_CHI2

 PURPOSE: 
   Computes the chi2 for a transit and/or RV for a single planet

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
    chi2 = exofast_chi2v2(pars)

 INPUTS:

    PARS - An array of parameters that describes the model. There
           should be one for each parameter in the structure where
           fit==true. This array should be generated by str2pars.pro.

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:
 
    PSNAME      - If specified, this routine will generate
                  postscript figure for each model generated with a
                  base of PSNAME. 

 OPTIONAL OUTPUTS:
    
    DETERMINANT - The determinant of the Jacobian to weight the
                  acceptance likelihood in order to impose
                  non-uniform priors in the stepping parameters. This
                  is equal to 1 (no transformation) unless MIST
                  models are used. If MIST models are used,
                  DETERMINANT is equal to d(EEP)/d(Age) to transform
                  the uniform EEP prior into a uniform Age prior.
    MODELRV     - The RV model given the parameters
    MODELFLUX   - The Transit model given the parameters
    DERIVED     - An array of derived parameters. Nothing is ever
                  returned in DERIVED, but this keyword is required
                  by EXOFAST_DEMC.

 RESULT:
    The chi^2 of the model given the data and parameters.

 NAME:
   exofast_demc
 PURPOSE:
   Make NCHAINS independent Markov Chain Monte Carlo chains to fit data
   and return the parameter distributions.

 DESCRIPTION:
   Begins by determining the correct stepping scale by finding
   differences in each parameters that yield a delta chi^2 = 1, then
   uses 5*scale*randomn offsets in each parameter for the starting
   points of each chain.

   It then begins a Differential Evolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo
   fit (ter Braak, 2006)
   http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/stuff_for_blog/cajo.pdf.  The
   only slight modification to this basic alogorithm is that we
   determine the magnitude of the uniform random deviate for each
   parameter. We have found the dynamic range of our parameters can
   be large, and thus not well suited to the one-size fits all
   approach recommended there.

   After taking 5% of MAXSTEPS, the program will estimate how many steps
   will be necessary to be well-mixed. If it is not expected to be
   well-mixed before taking the maximum number of steps, it will
   output a warning and a recommended setting for NTHIN. This should
   be accurate at the factor of 2-3 level.

   The program stops when the chains are well-mixed, as defined by
   Ford 2006 (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJ...642..505F)
   using the Gelman-Rubin Statistic and number of independent draws,
   or when each chain has taken MAXSTEPS, whichever is first.

   Every step in the chain before all chains have crossed below the
   median chi^2 will be considered the (the "burn-in"), and not used
   for convergence tests. BURNNDX will specify the index of the first
   useable step so as not to be biased by the starting criteria.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
   exofast_demc, bestpars, 'mychi2', pars [,CHI2=, TOFIT=,$
                 SCALE=, SEED=,RANDOMFUNC=,NTHIN=, MAXSTEPS=,/DONTSTOP,$
                 NCHAINS=, ANGULAR=,BURNNDX=,/REMOVEBURN]

 INPUTS:
   BESTPARS   - Array of the best-fit parameters. An accurate initial
                fit is required to find the correct step size. MCMC
                is not ideal for fitting data, just characterizing
                the errors.
   CHI2FUNC   - A string that specifies the name of the user-defined
                function that calculates the chi^2 of a given
                parameter set. Required data should be put in a
                COMMON block. Its calling sequence must be:
                chi2 = chi2func(pars, determinant=determinant)

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:
   TOFIT      - An array that indexes the parameters to fit. If not
                specified, all parameters are fit.
   ANGULAR    - An array that indexes the parameters that are
                angular (must be in radians). This will enable
                special ways to calculate the median and convergence
                statistics, which may otherwise fail. Default is none.
   SCALE      - An NPARS array containing the stepping scales for
                each parameter. This is not recommended for normal
                use. If not specified, it will be automatically
                determined using EXOFAST_GETMCMCSCALE.
   NTHIN      - Saves only every NTHINth link in each chain. This
                is only recommended when the autocorrelation between
                steps is large and memory management issues may
                arise. Results will be more accurate the smaller this
                is -- as long as the chain is well-mixed (pay
                attention to the warnings).
   MAXSTEPS   - The maximum number of steps (after thinning) for each
                chain to take.  The default is 100,000. Take care when
                increasing this number, as memory allocation issues
                may arise (especially with 32 bit machines). If the
                chain is not well-mixed, it is usually better to
                increase NTHIN instead.
   NCHAINS    - The number of independent chains to run. The
                execution time scales ~linearly with this number, and
                must be at least 3 to calculated convergence
                statistics. The default is 10. 
   SEED       - A seed for the random number generator. Do not mix
                seeds from different random number
                generators, and do not use several different seeds
                for the same generator. If you use a random number
                generator elsewhere, you should call EXOFAST_DEMC with
                SEED. Default is -systime(/seconds). 
   RANDOMFUNC - A string for the name of the random number generator
                function. You can use your own as long as it returns
                a uniform double precision deviate between 0 and 1,
                accepts the /NORMAL keyword to generate random
                gaussian deviates, and can return at least a two
                dimensional array of deviates. You may also choose
                between "EXOFAST_RANDOM" (default) or "RANDOMU".
              - EXOFAST_RANDOM is an IDL wrapper for pg_ran. This is
                a state of the art, bullet-proof generator with no
                known statistical flaws, based on the third edition
                of numerical recipes, pg 342. It is ~120x slower than
                RANDOMU, though for typical DEMC fits, this accounts
                for ~1% of the total runtime.
              - RANDOMU is IDL's built-in, ran1-based generator with a
                periodicity of ~10^9. ran1 is formally admonished by
                its author, Numerical Recipes, but shown to give
                identical results as the state of the art generator
                See Eastman et. al., 2013 for more details.
                http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013PASP..125...83E
   MAXGR      - The maximum Gelman Rubin statistic that is
                considered well-mixed (default=1.01)
   MINTZ      - The minimum number of independent draws that is
                considered well-mixed (default=1000)

 OPTIONAL KEYWORDS:
   DONTSTOP   - If set, the program will not stop when it is
                converged, but will instead take MAXSTEPS steps in
                each chain.
   REMOVEBURN - If set, the burn-in will be removed in the returned
                parameter array.
 OUTPUTS:
   PARS       - NFIT x NSTEPS x NCHAINS array of parameters.
                NOTE: NSTEPS will be the lesser of when it is
                converged or MAXSTEPS. 
   CHI2       - NSTEPS x NCHAINS array with the chi^2 for each set of
                parameters
   DERIVED    - An NDERIVED x NSTEPS x NCHAINS array of parameters
                that are derived during the chi^2 function. To
                conserve memory, these should be reserved for
                parameters that cannot be trivially rederived.

 SYSTEM VARIABLES:
   !STOPNOW   - If set, will break the MCMC loop at the next complete
                step. It must finish the current step, including all
                NTHIN and NCHAIN evaluations. To set it, type
                <CONTROL> + C
                !STOPNOW = 1 
                .con

 REVISION HISTORY:
   2012/06 - Public Release - Jason Eastman (LCOGT)
   2012/12 - When parameters aren't mixed, display the index
             to the (more) static PARS array, not the index to the
             dynamic TOFIT array.
           - Removed memory-hungry vestigial code
   2013/03 - Add GELMANRUBIN and TZ outputs, MAXGR, MINTZ inputs.
             Added DERIVED output, to return non-trivially derived
             parameters.
             Added check for errant chains (stuck in local minima)
             and discard them if the chains are not well-mixed at the
             end. This is sketchy, but better than nothing.
             This was a relatively common failure mode.

 NAME:
   exofast_errell

 PURPOSE: 
   Gives the path of the error ellipses at constant probability given
   two parameter distributions.

 PROCEDURE
   1. Creates a 2D histogram of the data with NBINS bins per
   parameter.
   2. Calculates the fraction of data points above each value in the
   histogram.
   3. Compares each calculated fraction with the probabilities,
   and defines the closest as the levels to pass to CONTOUR.
   4. Creates a contour plot of the 2D histogram
   5. Scales the path to be in the same units as the input and
   recreates the path, adding NaNs between each level for easy
   plotting

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
   exofast_errell, xpar, ypar [,NXBIN=nxbin,NYBIN=nybin,PROBS=PROBS]$
                   [,XPATH=xpath][,YPATH=ypath][,/PLOT][,/OPLOT]

 INPUTS:
   XPAR       - A vector of parameters to be plotted on the x axis.
   YPAR       - A vector of parameters to be plotted on the y axis.

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:
   NXBIN      - The number of bins to take in each direction. Default
                is 100. If you have only a small number of values for
                xpar and ypar (10000), this should be smaller. 
   NYBIN      - The number of bins to take in each direction. Default
                is NXBIN.
   XMIN/YMIN  - The minimum x/y value to make the contours
   XMAX/YMAX  - The maximum x/y value to make the contours
   PROBS      - An array containing the probability contours to
                plot. The default is
                probs = erf([1.d0,2.d0]/sqrt(2.d0)), or
                probs = [0.6826894921370859d0,$
                         0.9544997361036416d0]
                Note: to have a meaningful contour enclosing 99.7% of
                the points, you must have ~1 million points or make
                NBINS smaller.
  
 OPTIONAL KEYWORDS:
   PLOT       - Plot the contours on a new plot
   OPLOT      - Overplot the contours on an existing plot

 OPTIONAL OUTPUTS:
   XPATH/YPATH - The x/y values of the contours. For more
                 customizable plotting, return these and plot inside
                 your own program. All contours can be plotted simply
                 with IDL> plot, xpath, ypath
                 NOTE: XPATH/YPATH contain NaNs between levels to make the
                 plotting easier.
   OUTSIDENDX  - The indices of the parameters outside of the
                 outer-most contour (requires David Fanning's Inside
                 procedure)

 EXAMPLE:
 plot the 68% and 95% contours, and every point outside them 

 x = randomn(seed,100000)
 y = randomn(seed,100000)
 exofast_errell, x,y,out=out,probs=[0.68,0.95],xpath=xpath,ypath=ypath
 plot, xpath, ypath, /iso
 if out[0] ne -1 then oplot, x[out],y[out],psym=3

 DEPENDENCIES:
 INSIDE (Coyote library):

 NOTE: there is non-vectorized version of his code online, which will
 not work. Use the one at the link above.

 REVISION HISTORY:
   2010/03/01 - Written: Jason Eastman - The Ohio State University
   2010/11/05 - Added OUTSIDENDX output (inspired by Ben Shappee, OSU)
                Added, NXBIN, XMIN, XMAX, NYBIN, YMIN, YMAX inputs.
   2011/03/25 - Better memory management for INSIDE -- split up
                array to check (takes a little longer, but actually
                works with large arrays!)

   chains, and determines whether or not the chains are well mixed
   according to the Ford 2006 prescription: 
   http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJ...642..505F 

   This is meant to be a dependency of EXOFAST_DEMC. An example of
   its use can be seen there.

 PROCEDURE
   Calculates the Gelman-Rubin statistic and the number of
   independent draws for each parameter, as defined by Ford, 2006. The
   chain is considered well-mixed if all parameters have a
   Gelman-Rubin statistic of <= MAXGR (default = 1.01) and >= MINTZ
   (default = 1000) independent draws.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
   ismixed = exofast_gelmanrubin(pars)

 INPUTS:
   PARS0       - A 3 dimensional array (NPARS,NSTEPS,NCHAINS) of
                 parameter values
 OPTIONAL INPUTS:
   MAXGR       - The maximum Gelman Rubin statistic that is
                 considered well-mixed (default=1.01)
   MINTZ       - The minimum number of independent draws that is
                 considered well-mixed (default=1000)

 OPTIONAL OUTPUTS:
   GELMANRUBIN - An NPARS element array containing the Gelman-Rubin
                 statistic for each parameter (equation 25).
   TZ          - An NPARS element array containing the number of
                 independent draws for each parameter (equation 26).

 OPTIONAL KEYWORDS:
   ANGULAR     - An array of indices (with up to NPARS elements)
                 indicating which elements are angular values. If
                 specified, these parameters will be re-centered
                 about the mode value before calculating the
                 statisitics (the original array will not be
                 modified). If left blank, no scaling will be performed. 
                 NOTE: angular values must be in radians.

 NAME:
   exofast_getmcmcscale
 PURPOSE:
   Returns the optimal scale for MCMC chains by varying it until the
   delta chi^2 = 1.

 PROCEDURE:
   Calculates the chi^2 of the best fit model. Then, for each
   parameter, takes a small positive step (defined by seedscale) and
   re-calculates the chi^2. It brackets the value that yields delta
   chi^2 = 1 by doubling the seedscale until delta chi^2 > 1, then
   does a binary search to find the value that is as close as
   possible to delta chi^2 = 1. It repeats with a small negative
   step. The average of the positive and negative excursion is
   returned as the optimal scale.

   If the best fit is accurate and the errors are
   gaussian, uncorrelated, and accurately describe the data
   (chi^2/dof = 1), this will result in the optimal acceptance rate
   for MCMC fitting, 44% for 1 parameter, approaching 23% as the
   number of parameters is large.

 INPUTS:
   BESTPARS   - An NPARS element array of the best fit parameters
   CHI2FUNC   - A string of the named function that calculates the
                chi^2 of your model given the parameters specified by
                BESTPARS.

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:
   SEEDSCALE  - An NPARS arrray that contains the small step that is
                initially taken. If the chi^2 surface is a smooth,
                monotonically increasing surface, then it only
                affects execution time of the program. Since the
                chi^2 surface is rarely so forgiving, it's better to
                err on the side of too small. The default is 1d-3 for
                each parameter.
   BESTCHI2   - The chi^2 of the best fit parameters. If not given, it
                is calculated from BESTPARS using CHI2FUNC.
   ANGULAR    - An array of indices (with up to NPARS elements)
                indicating which elements are angular values. If
                specified, and the step sizes determined are larger
                than 2*pi, the step size will be set to pi.
                NOTE: angular values must be in radians.

 OPTIONAL KEYWORDS:
  DEBUG       - If set, it will print progress to the screen that
                will help identify problems.

 REVISION HISTORY:
   2009/11/23 - Written: Jason Eastman - The Ohio State University
   2013/02/26 - Change print statement to message statement
   2013/03/08 - If it hits a boundary, take the minimum step as the
                stepping scale. We just need a good ballpark, DEMC
                will do the rest.

 MCMCSS - The MCMC Stellar structure output by exofastv2.pro 

 EPOCHS - An NPLANETS pointer array (must match mcmcss.nplanets),
          pointing to an array specifying the epochs of the desired
          transit times. A null pointer signifies no output desired
          for that planet.

 NSAMPLES - This calculation is expensive and may take a decent
            fraction of the total MCMC runtime. We randomly sample
            NSAMPLES from the MCMCSS values to compute the
            uncertainty in each transit time. Default is 1000. Use -1
            or a value larger than mcmcss.nvalues to compute the Tcs
            at each epoch for all values.

 RESULT - An NPLANETS pointer array, pointing to an NEPOCHS x NSAMPLES
          array of Transit times, including stellar reflex motion and
          fitted TTVs.

                instead of the screen
   PARNAMES   - If specified, the table will include the parameter
                names as specified by this keyword. Otherwise they will
                be left blank. Parameter names will be bracketed by
                "$" so they are written in math mode.
   UNITS      - If specified, the table will include this
                discriptor/units next to the parameters. Otherwise they will
                be left blank.
   TITLE      - The title of the table
   LABEL      - The label for the table
   CAPTION    - The caption of the table
   ORDER      - An array of indices that specify the order of
                outputs. Default is the input order. If SIDELABLES
                are used, -1 should be inserted in each place the
                next label should be printed.
   SIDELABELS - An array of side labels to print. The number of
                elements must match the number of -1s in the ORDER
                array (this is where each lable will be inserted).
 OUTPUTS:
   Prints the latex source code to generate a table of values.

                names as specified by this keyword. Otherwise they will
                be left blank. Parameter names will be bracketed by
                "$" so they are written in math mode.
   UNITS      - If specified, the table will include this
                discriptor/units next to the parameters. Otherwise they will
                be left blank.
   TITLE      - The title of the table
   LABEL      - The label for the table
   CAPTION    - The caption of the table
   ORDER      - An array of indices that specify the order of
                outputs. Default is the input order. If SIDELABLES
                are used, -1 should be inserted in each place the
                next label should be printed.
   SIDELABELS - An array of side labels to print. The number of
                elements must match the number of -1s in the ORDER
                array (this is where each lable will be inserted).
 OUTPUTS:
   Prints the latex source code to generate a table of values.

 NAME:
       EXOFAST_LIKE
 PURPOSE:
       Calculates the log likelihood for the given residuals and
       errors. A simpler (and faster) alternative to the wavelet
       analysis of Carter & Winn 2009.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       result = exofast_like(residuals, sigma_r, sigma_w [,/chi2])

 INPUTS:
   RESIDUALS - The residuals of a fit (data-model)
   SIGMA_R   - Red noise amplitude parameter
   SIGMA_W   - White noise amplitude parameter

 OPTIONAL KEYWORDS:
   CHI2    - If set, will return the "equivalent chi2". The result
             (-2d0*loglike) is not actually the chi^2, but (a hack),
             designed to be the required output of CHI2FUNC called by
             EXOFAST_DEMC such that it uses the likelihood rather
             than the chi^2. It is equivalent because the difference
             between this and the true chi^2 is a constant that
             cancels when comparing two models (and is ultimately a
             deficiency in using the chi^2 rather than the
             likelihood). This allows us to fit a red noise term
             (sigma_r) while maintaining backward compatibility with
             EXOFAST_DEMC.
  TRUECHI2 - If set, will return the actual chi2.

 OUTPUTS:
    RESULT - alog(likelihood), as defined in Eastman et al., 2013, eqn
             1.

 EXAMPLES:

    ;; return the effective chi2 (for use with EXOFAST_DEMC) with an 
    ;; error scaling term but no red noise
    chi2 = exofast_like(residuals, 0d0, err*scale,/chi2)

 NAME:
   EXOFAST_LOMBSCARGLE

 PURPOSE: 
   This function returns the NMIN best periods determined by a
   lomb-scargle periodogram. 
 
 CALLING SEQUENCE:
   periods = exofast_lombscargle(time, rv [BESTPARS=,
   SCALE=, NMIN=, MINPERIOD=, MAXPERIOD=,NOSLOPE=, /NYQUIST, /PLOT])

 INPUTS:
   TIME        - A time (eg, BJD_TDB) for each of the RV data points
   RV          - The RV data points

 OPTIONAL OUTPUTS:  
   BESTPARS    - The best (analytically fit) parameters determined from
                 the lomb-scargle periodogram (assumes circular orbit).
   SCALE       - The scale (~error) of the period, determined by the
                 spacing of the sampling of the periodogram.
   NMIN        - The number of periods corresponding to chi^2 minima
                 to return (default=5)
   MINPERIOD   - The minimum period to explore. Default = 1 unit of
                 time (typically days). This value is not used if
                 /NYQUIST is set.
   MAXPERIOD   - The maximum period to explore. Default is the full
                 range of dates.

 OPTIONAL KEYWORDS
   SLOPE       - If set, a slope trend is analytically fit to the RV data.
   QUAD        - If set, a quadratic trend is analytically fit to the RV data.
   NYQUIST     - If set, the minimum period explored is the nyquist
                 frequency (half the minimum spacing between two
                 times). This takes precedence over MINPERIOD. Unless
                 the times are uniformly spaced (which is not
                 typical), use of this keyword is not recommended.
   PLOT        - A diagnostic tool. If set, the lomb-scargle
                 periodogram will be plotted, with the best period(s)
                 overplotted. This is useful for determining good
                 bounds, or if the observed behavior is unexpected.

 DEPENDENCIES:
   BUIELIB (http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~buie/idl/)

 OUTPUTS:
    result     - An NMIN elements array containing the best periods
                 determined from the lomb-scargle periodogram.

 Name:
   EXOFAST_MULTIPLOT

 Purpose:
	Create multiple plots with simple control over the gaps between plots.
   By default, the gap is zero but this can be set with the
   gap= keyword, or xgap=, ygap= for individual control over different axes.
   You can also place a single title along the x, y and top axes of the
   matrix of plots using the mtitle, mxtitle and mytitle keywords.

	It is good for data with one or two shared axes and retains all the
	versatility of the plot commands (e.g. all keywords and log scaling).
	The plots are connected with the shared axes, which saves space by
	omitting redundant ticklabels and titles.  Multiplot does this by
	setting !p.position, !x.tickname and !y.tickname automatically.
	A call (multiplot,/reset) restores original values.

   Coyote graphics users can find similar functionality in CGLAYOUT
        http://www.idlcoyote.com/idldoc/cg/cglayout.html
   Users of the post-8.0 IDL function graphics can find similar functionality
   in Paulo Penteado's routine PP_MULTIPLOT
        http://ppenteado.net/idl/pp_lib/doc/pp_multiplot__define.html
 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	multiplot, pmulti, 
       gap=, xgap=, ygap=, 
       /square, 
       /doxaxis, /doyaxis, 
       mTitle=, mTitSize=, mTitOffset=, 
       mxTitle=, mxTitSize=, mxTitOffset=, 
       myTitle=, myTitSize=, myTitOffset=, 
       xtickformat=, ytickformat=
       /default, /reset, /rowmajor, /initialize

 INPUTS:
   pmulti: Optional input. [Nx,Ny] array describing the shape of the
       matrix of plots.  This is equivalent to the 2nd and 3rd elements
       of !p.multi.  Or you can send all 5 elements of the !p.multi.

 KEYWORD INPUTS:
   gap=: Set the gap between plots in normalized units.  Default is 0.
       This input overrides the xgap and ygap inputs.
   xgap=: Gap between plots in the x direction. Default 0. To set both
       x and y gap to the same value just use the gap keyword.
   ygap=: Gap between plots in the y direction. Default 0. To set both
       x and y gap to the same value just use the gap keyword.

   mTitle: A single title to go across the top of the matrix of plots,
       as opposed to the plot over single plots you generate with the
       plot command for example. 
   mTitSize: The font size of the top title. Default is 1.25*!p.charsize
   mTitOffset: Offset of the title in the y-direction.
   mxTitle, mxTitSize, mxTitOffset: same as above but for the x-axis title
   myTitle, myTitSize, myTitOffset: same as above but for the y-axis title

   xtickformat, ytickformat: Set the default tick formats when the ticks
       are plotted. This allows the user to avoid sending this to each
       plotting command which can have unexpected results if that axis
       was not to get tick labels in a given point in the matrix.

 KEYWORDS SWITCHES:
   /square: Force the axis ratio of each plot to be square. Note if
       xgap and ygap are set to different values, this axis ratio will
       not be preserved.  It will be preserved if gap= is used.

   /doxaxis: Put axis labels, etc on the axis. Default is to place labels
       only on the left side and bottom sides of the plot matrix, but may
       be useful when some cells are empty; for example the x-axis of
       a 2x2 grid when only 3 total plots will be created.
   /doyaxis: Put axis labels, etc on the yxis.  Default is to place labels
       only on the left side and bottom sides of the plot matrix, but may
       be useful when some cells are empty; for example the x-axis of
       a 2x2 grid when only 3 total plots will be created.

   /rowmajor: Like setting 5th element of !p.multi to 1. 
   /reset: Set plotting parameters to their saved values from before
       multiplot was initially called.
   /default: Set plotting parameters to IDL defaults.  This is useful
       when the saved parameters get in a whacky state.
   /initialize: Just do the initialization. This is what happends when
       you first call multiplot anyway.

 EXAMPLES:
   ; Make an array of plots [4,3] with a gap of 0.1 (in norm. coords.)
   ; and overall titles along the x and y axes as given.  Force the
   ; plots to be square.

       cgerase & multiplot, [4,3], /square, gap=0.1, mXtitle='R', mYtitle='F(R)'
       for i=0,4*3-1 do begin
           cgplot, struct[i].x, struct[i].y, psym=4
           multiplot
       endfor
       multiplot,/reset

 Side Effects:
   Multiplot sets a number of system variables: !p.position, !p.multi,
	!x.tickname, !y.tickname, !P.noerase---but all can be reset with
	the call: multiplot,/reset  

   Things can get out of wack if your program crashes in the middle of 
   making a matrix of plots, and often /reset will not fix it.  In those 
   cases, calling multiplot,/default will often fix the problem.

 Restrictions:
	1. If you use !p.multi as the method of telling how many plots
	are present, you have to set !p.multi at the beginning each time you
	use multiplot or call multiplot with the /reset keyword.
	2. There is no way to make plots of different sizes; each plot
	covers the same area on the screen or paper.

 Modification history:
	write, 21-23 Mar 94, Fred Knight (knight@ll.mit.edu)
	alter plot command that sets !x.window, etc. per suggestion of
	  Mark Hadfield (hadfield@storm.greta.cri.nz), 7 Apr 94, FKK
	add a /default keyword restore IDL's default values of system vars,
	  7 Apr 94, FKK
	modify two more sys vars !x(y).tickformat to suppress user-formatted
	  ticknames, per suggestion of Mark Hadfield (qv), 8 Apr 94, FKK
       
   2001-03-20    Added /square keyword
       Work in device coordinates so we can force aspect ratio to be square 
       if requested. Erin Scott Sheldon UMichigan
       
   2007-06-18
       Can now place titles on the overall x and y axes, as well as a 
       top title using these new keywords. 
           mTitle=, mTitSize=, mTitOffset=, 
           mxTitle=, mxTitSize=, mxTitOffset=, 
           myTitle=, myTitSize=, myTitOffset=, 
       Can also control overall tick formats. Useful because can just call
       multiplot initially and set this, while calling on each call to
       the plotting program will have unexpected results if the ticks
       are not to be labelled for that place in the matrix.
           xtickformat, ytickformat

   2007-08-28:

 NAME: 
   EXOFAST_QUERYVIZIER

 PURPOSE: 
   Query any catalog in the Vizier database by position
 
 EXPLANATION:
   Uses the IDL SOCKET command to provide a positional query of any catalog 
   in the the Vizier (http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/) database over the Web and
   return results in an IDL structure.    
 
    
 CALLING SEQUENCE: 
     info = exofast_QueryVizier(catalog, targetname_or_coords, [ dis
                        /ALLCOLUMNS, /CFA, CONSTRAINT= ,/VERBOSE ])

 INPUTS: 
      CATALOG - Scalar string giving the name of the VIZIER catalog to be
            searched.    The complete list of catalog names is available at
            http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/vizier/cats/U.htx . 

            Popular VIZIER catalogs include 
            'II/328'- AllWISE Data Release (Cutri+ 2013)
            'V/139' - Sloan SDSS photometric catalog Release 9 (2012)
            '2MASS-PSC' - 2MASS point source catalog (2003)
            'GSC2.3' - Version 2.3.2 of the HST Guide Star Catalog (2006)
            'USNO-B1' - Verson B1 of the US Naval Observatory catalog (2003)
            'UCAC4'  - 4th U.S. Naval Observatory CCD Astrograph Catalog (2012)
            'B/DENIS/DENIS' - 2nd Deep Near Infrared Survey of southern Sky (2005)
            'I/337/gaia' - Gaia DR1 Data Release 1 (2016)
            'I/311/HIP2' - Hipparcos main catalog, new reduction (2007)

          Note that some names will prompt a search of multiple catalogs
          and QUERYVIZIER will only return the result of the first search.
          Thus, setting catalog to "HIP2" will search all catalogs 
          associated with the Hipparcos mission, and return results for the
          first catalog found.    To specifically search the Hipparcos or
          Tycho main catalogs use the VIZIER catalog names listed above
                             
      TARGETNAME_OR_COORDS - Either a scalar string giving a target name, 
          (with J2000 coordinates determined by SIMBAD), or a 2-element
          numeric vector giving the J2000 right ascension in *degrees* and 
          the target declination in degrees.
          If the targetname is set to 'NONE' then QUERYVIZIER will perform
          an all-sky search using the constraints given in the CONSTRAINT
          keyword.   
 OPTIONAL INPUT:
    dis - scalar or 2-element vector.   If one value is supplied then this
          is the search radius in arcminutes.     If two values are supplied
          then this is the width (i.e., in longitude direction) and height
          of the search box.   Default is a radius search with radius of
          5 arcminutes

 OUTPUTS: 
   info - Anonymous IDL structure containing information on the catalog  
          sources within the specified distance of the specified center.  The 
          structure tag names are identical with the VIZIER  catalog column 
          names, with the exception of an occasional underscore
          addition, if necessary to convert the column name to a valid 
          structure tag.    The VIZIER Web  page should consulted for the 
          column names and their meaning for each particular catalog..
           
          If the tagname is numeric and the catalog field is blank then either
          NaN  (if floating) or -1 (if integer) is placed in the tag.

          If no sources are found within the specified radius, or an
          error occurs in the query then -1 is returned. 
 OPTIONAL KEYWORDS:
          /ALLCOLUMNS - if set, then all columns for the catalog are returned
                 The default is to return a smaller VIZIER default set. 

          /CFA - By default, the query is sent to the main VIZIER site in
            Strasbourg, France.   If /CFA is set then the VIZIER site
            at the Harvard Center for Astrophysics (CFA) is used instead.
            Note that not all Vizier sites have the option to return
            tab-separated values (TSV) which is required by this program.
   
          CONSTRAINT - string giving additional nonpositional numeric 
            constraints on the entries to be selected.     For example, when 
            in the GSC2.3  catalog, to only select sources with Rmag < 16 set 
            Constraint = 'Rmag<16'.    Multiple constraints can be 
            separated by commas.    Use '!=' for "not equal", '<=' for smaller
            or equal, ">=" for greater than or equal.  See the complete list
            of operators at  
                 http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/doc/asu.html#AnnexQual
            For this keyword only, **THE COLUMN NAME IS CASE SENSITIVE** and 
            must be written exactly as displayed on the VIZIER Web page.  
            Thus for the GSC2.3 catalog one must use 'Rmag' and not 'rmag' or
            'RMAG'.    In addition, *DO NOT INCLUDE ANY BLANK SPACE* unless it 
            is a necessary part of the query.
         
           /SILENT - If set, then no message will be displayed if no sources
                are found.    Error messages are still displayed.
           /VERBOSE - If set then the query sent to the VIZIER site is
               displayed, along with the returned title(s) of found catalog(s)
 EXAMPLES: 
          (1) Plot a histogram of the J magnitudes of all 2MASS point sources 
          stars within 10 arcminutes of the center of the globular cluster M13 

          IDL>  info = queryvizier('2MASS-PSC','m13',10)
          IDL> plothist,info.jmag,xran=[10,20]

          (2)  Find the brightest J mag GSC2.3 source within 3' of the 
               J2000 position ra = 10:12:34, dec = -23:34:35
          
          IDL> str = queryvizier('GSC2.3',[ten(10,12,34)*15,ten(-23,34,35)],3)
          IDL> print,min(str.jmag,/NAN)

          (3) Find sources with V < 19 in the Magellanic Clouds Photometric 
              Survey (Zaritsky+, 2002) within 5 arc minutes of  the position 
              00:47:34 -73:06:27

              Checking the VIZIER Web page we find that this catalog is
          IDL>  catname =  'J/AJ/123/855/table1'
          IDL>  ra = ten(0,47,34)*15 & dec = ten(-73,6,27)
          IDL> str = queryvizier(catname, [ra,dec], 5, constra='Vmag<19')

          (4) Perform an all-sky search of the Tycho-2 catalog for stars with
              BTmag = 13+/-0.1

         IDL> str = queryvizier('I/259/TYC2','NONE',constrain='BTmag=13+/-0.1')

 PROCEDURES USED:
          GETTOK(), REMCHAR, REPSTR(), STRCOMPRESS2(), ZPARCHECK

 NAME:
        EXOFAST_RANDOM

 PURPOSE: 

        EXOFAST_RANDOM is a wrapper for pg_ran, the IDL translation
        of ran from "Numerical Recipes Third Edition", page 342 by
        Paolo C. Grigis, to make it a drop in replacement of RANDOMU
        for normal or uniform deviates.
        http://hea-www.cfa.harvard.edu/~pgrigis/idl_stuff/pg_ran.pro

        While statistically, it is a far superior routine to IDL's
        built-in, ran1 based, RANDOMU, it is also substantially (120x)
        slower, as random number generators require serial
        operations, which IDL does poorly.

        If sequences larger than ~10^7 are required, IDL's built-in
        routine is insufficient.

        Call with a NEGATIVE or UNDEFINED SEED TO INITIALIZE
        thereafter, do not alter seed between successive deviates in
        a sequence.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

        Result = EXOFAST_RANDOM(Seed [, D1, ..., Dn,/normal])

 INPUTS:
         Seed   - A named variable containing the seed value for
                  random number generation. Seed is updated
                  once for each random number generated. The initial
                  value of Seed should be set to different NEGATIVE
                  values in order to obtain different random
                  sequences. An undefined variable name can be
                  specified and it will begin the seed with
                  -systime(/seconds). It is an error not to specify a
                  seed.
 OPTIONAL INPUTS:
        Di      - The dimensions of the result. The dimension
                  parameters can be any scalar expression. Up to eight
                  dimensions can be specified. If no dimensions are
                  specified, RAN2 returns a scalar result
 OPTIONAL KEYWORDS:
        NORMAL  - Set this keyword to generate random normal deviates
                  which uses an IDL translation of the Numerical
                  Recipes routine gasdev with the uniform deviates
                  generated from pg_ran.

 OUTPUTS:
        This function returns uniform random deviates between 0.0 and
        1.0 (exclusive of the endpoint values) or normal deviates if
        /NORMAL is set, with array dimensions given by the input
        parameters, D1, ..., Dn.

 INPUTS:
    x      - array of star-planet distances in the x direction
             (stellar radii).
    y      - array or scalar of star-planet distance(s) in the y
             direction. ie, the impact parameter (stellar radii)
    u1     - linear limb-darkening coefficient -- epsilon in paper
    p      - occulting star size (stellar radii) -- gamma in paper
    vsini  - projected stellar surface velocity (same as output units)
    lambda - projected spin-orbit angle (radians)
    
 OPTIONAL INPUTS:
    z      - array of star-planet distances in the z direction. 
               -- Positive => in front of star (RM effect)
               -- Negative => behind star (no effect)
               -- assumed positive if not specified
 OUTPUTS:
    deltarv - Approximate Change in RV at each z due to the Rossiter
              Mclaughlin effect (units same as vsini) 
                     *** accurate to ~1 m/s ***

               Astronomical Twilight = -18 degrees.
   TZ        - The timezone of the observatory, in hours west of
               Greenwich. Ignored unless /LOCAL is set.

 OPTIONAL KEYWORDS:
   SUNSET    - Return the time of sunset instead of sunrise.
   LOCAL     - Return the result in local time. TZ must be specified
               if this keyword is set.

 NAME:
   GETBURNNDX
 PURPOSE:
   Returns the index of the first useable link in a Markov chain.

 DESCRIPTION: 
   Determines the point at which all chains have had at least one
   chi^2 lower than the median chi^2 of the best chain. If some
   chains never reach this point or reach this point very late, they
   are ignored in the calculation.
   
   nsteps*0.1 <= burnndx <= nsteps*0.9
 
   That is...

   It will always discard at least 10% of the steps in case the
   initialization of the chains is insufficiently scattered around
   the best fit, which would bias the results toward the starting
   value.
 
   It will never discard more than 90% of the steps to enable the
   robust calculation of mixing criteria.

 CALLING SEQUENCE: 
   burnndx = getburnndx(chi2 [,GOODCHAINS=,BADCHAINS=])

 INPUTS:
   
   CHI2 - An NSTEPS x NCHAINS array of chi2 values
 
 OPTIONAL OUTPUTS:
 
   GOODCHAINS - An array of indices of chains that are good, meaning
                they have at least one point below the median of the
                best chain.  
   BADCHAINS  - An array of indices of chains that are bad, meaning
                their chi2 is never below the median of the best
                chain

   MEDCHI2    - The median chi2 of the best chain

 :Description:
    The JSON_PARSE function takes a JSON string and converts it into
    an IDL variable.

 :Returns:
    If *String* begins with a curly brace "{", then the result is
    a HASH, containing the unordered name-value pairs from the JSON string.
    If *String* begins with a square bracket "[", then the result is
    a LIST, containing the ordered collection of values.
    If *String* is a scalar string that does not begin with "{" or "[",
    then it is assumed to be a file name. If the file exists, then the
    contents of the file are read and parsed.

    *Note*: When converting JSON strings into IDL variables,
    the following rules are used:
      "null" becomes !NULL.
      "false" becomes byte 0, "true" becomes byte 1.
      Integer values become IDL variables of type LONG64.
      Floating-point numbers become IDL variables of type DOUBLE.
      Strings will be converted to IDL strings, and all \ escaped characters
      will be converted back to normal characters.
      JSON arrays will become IDL LIST variables.
      JSON objects will become IDL HASH variables.
   
    *Note*: Since the HASH stores its name-value pairs in an arbitrary
    order, the HASH::Keys() method may return the name-value pairs
    in a different order compared to the original JSON string.
   
 :Params:
    String:
      *String* must be a valid JSON string containing either a
      JSON *object* of name-value pairs, or a JSON *array* of values.

 :Keywords:
    None

 NAME:
   KTOM2

 PURPOSE: 
   Determine the mass of the secondary given the velocity
   semi-amplitude, eccentricity, inclination, Period, and mass of
   the primary.
 
 DESCRIPTION:
   Determines the mass of the secondary by analytically solving the
   cubic equation (only for the real root):

   m2^3 - (m1+m2)^2*(K*sqrt(1d0-e^2)/sin(i))^3*Period/(2d0*!dpi*G) = 0

   Inputs may be vectors or scalars, but must have the same number of
   elements.

   K must not be 0. 

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
   m2 = ktom2(K, e, i, P, m1)

 INPUTS:
   K           - The velocity semi-amplitude (m/s)
   e           - The eccentricity of the orbit
   i           - inclination of orbit (radians). To calculate the
                 minimum mass (msini, assuming M1 >> M2), use
                 i=!dpi/2d0.
   Period      - Period of orbit (days)
   M1          - The mass of the Primary (m_sun)
 OPTIONAL INPUTS:

   GMSun       - The solar gravitational parameter (G*MSun) in SI
                 units (m^3/s^2). If not set, the value from Standish
                 1995 is used (1.3271244d20), which has been adopted
                 by the IAU resolution.

 OUTPUTS:
   M2          - The mass of the secondary (m_sun)

 NAME:
       LEGEND
 PURPOSE:
       Create an annotation legend for a plot.
 EXPLANATION:
       This procedure makes a legend for a plot.  The legend can contain
       a mixture of symbols, linestyles, Hershey characters (vectorfont),
       and filled polygons (usersym).  A test procedure, legendtest.pro,
       shows legend's capabilities.  Placement of the legend is controlled
       with keywords like /right, /top, and /center or by using a position
       keyword for exact placement (position=[x,y]) or via mouse (/position).
 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       LEGEND [,items][,keyword options]
 EXAMPLES:
       The call:
               legend,['Plus sign','Asterisk','Period'],psym=[1,2,3]
         produces:
               -----------------
               |               |
               |  + Plus sign  |
               |  * Asterisk   |
               |  . Period     |
               |               |
               -----------------
         Each symbol is drawn with a plots command, so they look OK.
         Other examples are given in optional output keywords.

       lines = indgen(6)                       ; for line styles
       items = 'linestyle '+strtrim(lines,2)   ; annotations
       legend,items,linestyle=lines            ; vertical legend---upper left
       items = ['Plus sign','Asterisk','Period']
       sym = [1,2,3]
       legend,items,psym=sym                   ; ditto except using symbols
       legend,items,psym=sym,/horizontal       ; horizontal format
       legend,items,psym=sym,box=0             ; sans border
       legend,items,psym=sym,delimiter='='     ; embed '=' betw psym & text
       legend,items,psym=sym,margin=2          ; 2-character margin
       legend,items,psym=sym,position=[x,y]    ; upper left in data coords
       legend,items,psym=sym,pos=[x,y],/norm   ; upper left in normal coords
       legend,items,psym=sym,pos=[x,y],/device ; upper left in device coords
       legend,items,psym=sym,/position         ; interactive position
       legend,items,psym=sym,/right            ; at upper right
       legend,items,psym=sym,/bottom           ; at lower left
       legend,items,psym=sym,/center           ; approximately near center
       legend,items,psym=sym,number=2          ; plot two symbols, not one
       legend,items,/fill,psym=[8,8,8],colors=[10,20,30]; 3 filled squares
 INPUTS:
       items = text for the items in the legend, a string array.
               For example, items = ['diamond','asterisk','square'].
               You can omit items if you don't want any text labels.
 OPTIONAL INPUT KEYWORDS:

       linestyle = array of linestyle numbers  If linestyle[i] < 0, then omit
               ith symbol or line to allow a multi-line entry.     If 
               linestyle = -99 then text will be left-justified.  
       psym = array of plot symbol numbers.  If psym[i] is negative, then a
               line connects pts for ith item.  If psym[i] = 8, then the
               procedure usersym is called with vertices define in the
               keyword usersym.   If psym[i] = 88, then use the previously
               defined user symbol
       vectorfont = vector-drawn characters for the sym/line column, e.g.,
               ['!9B!3','!9C!3','!9D!3'] produces an open square, a checkmark,
               and a partial derivative, which might have accompanying items
               ['BOX','CHECK','PARTIAL DERIVATIVE'].
               There is no check that !p.font is set properly, e.g., -1 for
               X and 0 for PostScript.  This can produce an error, e.g., use
               !20 with PostScript and !p.font=0, but allows use of Hershey
               *AND* PostScript fonts together.
       N. B.: Choose any of linestyle, psym, and/or vectorfont.  If none is
               present, only the text is output.  If more than one
               is present, all need the same number of elements, and normal
               plot behaviour occurs.
               By default, if psym is positive, you get one point so there is
               no connecting line.  If vectorfont[i] = '',
               then plots is called to make a symbol or a line, but if
               vectorfont[i] is a non-null string, then xyouts is called.
       /help = flag to print header
       /horizontal = flag to make the legend horizontal
       /vertical = flag to make the legend vertical (D=vertical)
       box = flag to include/omit box around the legend (D=include)
		  outline_color = color of box outline (D = !P.color)
       clear = flag to clear the box area before drawing the legend
       delimiter = embedded character(s) between symbol and text (D=none)
       colors = array of colors for plot symbols/lines (D=!P.color)
       font = scalar font graphics keyword (-1,0 or 1) for text
       textcolors = array of colors for text (D=!P.color)
       margin = margin around text measured in characters and lines
       spacing = line spacing (D=bit more than character height)
       pspacing = psym spacing (D=3 characters) (when number of symbols is
             greater than 1)
       charsize = just like !p.charsize for plot labels
       charthick = just like !p.charthick for plot labels
       thick = array of line thickness numbers (D = !P.thick), if used, then 
               linestyle must also be specified
       position = data coordinates of the /top (D) /left (D) of the legend
       normal = use normal coordinates for position, not data
       device = use device coordinates for position, not data
       number = number of plot symbols to plot or length of line (D=1)
       usersym = 2-D array of vertices, cf. usersym in IDL manual. 
             (/USERSYM =square, default is to use existing USERSYM definition)
       /fill = flag to fill the usersym
       /left_legend = flag to place legend snug against left side of plot
                 window (D)
       /right_legend = flag to place legend snug against right side of plot
               window.    If /right,pos=[x,y], then x is position of RHS and
               text runs right-to-left.
       /top_legend = flag to place legend snug against top of plot window (D)
       /bottom = flag to place legend snug against bottom of plot window
               /top,pos=[x,y] and /bottom,pos=[x,y] produce same positions.

       If LINESTYLE, PSYM, VECTORFONT, THICK, COLORS, or TEXTCOLORS are
       supplied as scalars, then the scalar value is set for every line or
       symbol in the legend.
 Outputs:
       legend to current plot device
 OPTIONAL OUTPUT KEYWORDS:
       corners = 4-element array, like !p.position, of the normalized
         coords for the box (even if box=0): [llx,lly,urx,ury].
         Useful for multi-column or multi-line legends, for example,
         to make a 2-column legend, you might do the following:
           c1_items = ['diamond','asterisk','square']
           c1_psym = [4,2,6]
           c2_items = ['solid','dashed','dotted']

         Useful also to place the legend.  Here's an automatic way to place
         the legend in the lower right corner.  The difficulty is that the
         legend's width is unknown until it is plotted.  In this example,
         the legend is plotted twice: the first time in the upper left, the
         second time in the lower right.
           legend,['1','22','333','4444'],linestyle=indgen(4),corners=corners
                       ; BOGUS LEGEND---FIRST TIME TO REPORT CORNERS
           xydims = [corners[2]-corners[0],corners[3]-corners[1]]
                       ; SAVE WIDTH AND HEIGHT
           chdim=[!d.x_ch_size/float(!d.x_size),!d.y_ch_size/float(!d.y_size)]
                       ; DIMENSIONS OF ONE CHARACTER IN NORMALIZED COORDS
           pos = [!x.window[1]-chdim[0]-xydims[0] $
                       ,!y.window[0]+chdim[1]+xydims[1]]
                       ; CALCULATE POSITION FOR LOWER RIGHT
           plot,findgen(10)    ; SIMPLE PLOT; YOU DO WHATEVER YOU WANT HERE.
           legend,['1','22','333','4444'],linestyle=indgen(4),pos=pos
                       ; REDO THE LEGEND IN LOWER RIGHT CORNER
         You can modify the pos calculation to place the legend where you
         want.  For example to place it in the upper right:
           pos = [!x.window[1]-chdim[0]-xydims[0],!y.window[1]-xydims[1]]
 Common blocks:
       none
 Procedure:
       If keyword help is set, call doc_library to print header.
       See notes in the code.  Much of the code deals with placement of the
       legend.  The main problem with placement is not being
       able to sense the length of a string before it is output.  Some crude
       approximations are used for centering.
 Restrictions:
       Here are some things that aren't implemented.
       - An orientation keyword would allow lines at angles in the legend.
       - An array of usersyms would be nice---simple change.
       - An order option to interchange symbols and text might be nice.
       - Somebody might like double boxes, e.g., with box = 2.
       - Another feature might be a continuous bar with ticks and text.
       - There are no guards to avoid writing outside the plot area.
       - There is no provision for multi-line text, e.g., '1st line!c2nd line'
         Sensing !c would be easy, but !c isn't implemented for PostScript.
         A better way might be to simply output the 2nd line as another item
         but without any accompanying symbol or linestyle.  A flag to omit
         the symbol and linestyle is linestyle[i] = -1.
       - There is no ability to make a title line containing any of titles
         for the legend, for the symbols, or for the text.
 Side Effects:
 Modification history:
       write, 24-25 Aug 92, F K Knight (knight@ll.mit.edu)
       allow omission of items or omission of both psym and linestyle, add
         corners keyword to facilitate multi-column legends, improve place-
         ment of symbols and text, add guards for unequal size, 26 Aug 92, FKK
       add linestyle(i)=-1 to suppress a single symbol/line, 27 Aug 92, FKK
       add keyword vectorfont to allow characters in the sym/line column,
         28 Aug 92, FKK
       add /top, /bottom, /left, /right keywords for automatic placement at
         the four corners of the plot window.  The /right keyword forces
         right-to-left printing of menu. 18 Jun 93, FKK
       change default position to data coords and add normal, data, and
         device keywords, 17 Jan 94, FKK
       add /center keyword for positioning, but it is not precise because
         text string lengths cannot be known in advance, 17 Jan 94, FKK
       add interactive positioning with /position keyword, 17 Jan 94, FKK
       allow a legend with just text, no plotting symbols.  This helps in
         simply describing a plot or writing assumptions done, 4 Feb 94, FKK
       added thick, symsize, and clear keyword Feb 96, W. Landsman HSTX
               David Seed, HR Wallingford, d.seed@hrwallingford.co.uk
       allow scalar specification of keywords, Mar 96, W. Landsman HSTX
       added charthick keyword, June 96, W. Landsman HSTX
       Made keyword names  left,right,top,bottom,center longer,
                                 Aug 16, 2000, Kim Tolbert
       Added ability to have regular text lines in addition to plot legend 
       lines in legend.  If linestyle is -99 that item is left-justified.
       Previously, only option for no sym/line was linestyle=-1, but then text
       was lined up after sym/line column.    10 Oct 2000, Kim Tolbert
       Make default value of thick = !P.thick  W. Landsman  Jan. 2001
       Don't overwrite existing USERSYM definition  W. Landsman Mar. 2002
	     Added outline_color BT 24 MAY 2004
       Pass font keyword to xyouts commands.  M. Fitzgerald, Sep. 2005
       Default spacing, pspacing should be relative to charsize. M. Perrin, July 2007
       Don't modify position keyword  A. Kimball/ W. Landsman Jul 2007
       Small update to Jul 2007 for /NORMAL coords.  W. Landsman Aug 2007

 NAME:
   LINLD

 PURPOSE: 
   Interpolates the linear limb darkening tables of Claret and
   Bloemen (2011). http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011A%26A...529A..75C

 DESCRIPTION:
   Loads an IDL save file found in $EXOFAST_PATH/quadld/, then
   does a 3D linear interpolation of the table. 

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
    coeffs = linld(logg, teff, feh, band [,MODEL=, METHOD=, VT=]);
 INPUTS:
    LOGG - The log of the stellar surface gravity
    TEFF - The stellar effective temperature
    FEH  - The stellar metallicity
    BAND - The observed bandpass. Allowed values are those defined in
           Claret and Bloemen:
             U,B,V,R,I,J,H,K, (Johnson/Cousins)
             u',g',r',i',z', (Sloan)
             Kepler, CoRoT, 
             Spitzer 3.6 um, Spitzer 4.5 um, Spitzer 5.8 um Spitzer 8.0 um, 
             u,b,v,y (Stromgren)

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:
    MODEL  - The atmospheric model used to determine the limb
             darkening values. Choose ATLAS or PHOENIX (default ATLAS).
    METHOD - The method used. Choose L or F (default L)
    VT     - The microturbulent velocity (0,2,4,or 8, default 2)
 
 RESULT:
    The linear limb darkening parameter

 COMMON BLOCKS:
   LINLD_BLOCK - This is a self-contained block that stores the
                 contents of the IDL save files. This common block saves
                 the expensive step of restoring the same save files
                 for repeated calls (e.g., during and MCMC fit).

 MODIFICATION HISTORY
 
  2012/06 -- Public release -- Jason Eastman (LCOGT)
  2013/01 -- Changed save filenames so they're not case sensitive
             (now works with OSX)

 NAME:
   massradius_mist

 PURPOSE: 
   Interpolate the MIST stellar evolutionary models to derive Teff
   and Rstar from mass, metallicity, and age. Intended to be a drop in
   replacement for the Yonsie Yale model interpolation
   (massradius_yy3.pro).

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
   chi2 = massradius_mist(mstar, feh, age, teff, rstar, $
                          VVCRIT=vvcrit, ALPHA=alpha, SPAN=span,$
                          MISTRSTAR=mistrstar, MISTTEFF=mistteff)
 INPUTS:

    MSTAR  - The mass of the star, in m_sun
    FEH    - The metallicity of the star [Fe/H]
    AGE    - The age of the star, in Gyr
    RSTAR  - The radius you expect; used to calculate a chi^2
    TEFF   - The Teff you expect; used to calculate a chi^2
    
 OPTIONAL INPUTS:
   VVCRIT    - The rotational velocity normalized by the critical
               rotation speed. Must be 0.0d0 or 0.4d0 (default 0.0d0).
   ALPHA     - The alpha abundance. Must be 0.0 (default 0.0). A
               placeholder for future improvements to MIST models.
   SPAN      - The interpolation is done at the closest value +/-
               SPAN grid points in the evolutionary tracks in mass,
               age, metallicity. The larger this number, the longer it
               takes. Default=1. Change with care.
   EPSNAME   - A string specifying the name of postscript file to plot
               the evolutionary track. If not specified, no plot is
               generated.

 OPTIONAL KEYWORDS:
   DEBUG     - If set, will plot the teff and rstar over the MIST
               Isochrone.

 OPTIONAL OUTPUTS:
   MISTRSTAR - The rstar interpolated from the MIST models.
   MISTTEFF  - The Teff interpolated from the MIST models.

 RESULT:
   The chi^2 penalty due to the departure from the MIST models,
   assuming 3% errors in the MIST model values.

 COMMON BLOCKS:
   MIST_BLOCK:
     Loading EEPs (model tracks) is very slow. This common block
     allows us to store the tracks in memory between calls. The first
     call will take ~3 seconds. Subsequent calls that use the same
     EEP files take 1 ms.

 EXAMPLE: 
   ;; penalize a model for straying from the MIST models 
   chi2 += massradius_mist(mstar, feh, age, rstar=rstar, teff=teff)

 NAME:
   mkprior
 PURPOSE:

   Prints the contents of an EXOFASTv2 prior file so the next fit
   starts at the most likely model from a previous EXOFASTv2
   run. Often times such iteration can be helpful to make the fit
   converge faster, since it is often difficult to find a good best
   fit of complex fits with strong covariances and many parameters.

   Note: If priors widths or bounds were supplied in the original
   fit, these will be preserved and override the best-fit values.

 INPUTS:

   FILENAME - The name of an IDL save file containing an MCMCSS
              structure output by EXOFASTv2. Takes precendence over
              MCMCSS.

              Hint: a poorly behaving run can be terminated and still
              generate this file by typing "ctrl+c", then
              "!stopnow=1" and ".con" in the window.

   MCMCSS   - The stellar stucture output by EXOFASTv2.

   PRIORFILENAME - If specified, create a new priorfile with this
                   name. Otherwise, output to the screen.

   run. Often times such iteration can be helpful to make the fit
   converge faster, since it is often difficult to find a good best
   fit of complex fits with strong covariances and many parameters.

   Note: If priors widths or bounds were supplied in the original
   fit, these will be preserved and override the best-fit values.

 INPUTS:

   FILENAME - The name of an IDL save file containing an MCMCSS
              structure output by EXOFASTv2. Takes precendence over
              MCMCSS.

              Hint: a poorly behaving run can be terminated and still
              generate this file by typing "ctrl+c", then
              "!stopnow=1" and ".con" in the window.

   MCMCSS   - The stellar stucture output by EXOFASTv2.

   PRIORFILENAME - If specified, create a new priorfile with this
                   name. Otherwise, output to the screen.

 NAME:
   MKSS

 PURPOSE:
 Creates a stellar system structure that describes an arbitrary
 number of stars, planets, observed bands, rv telescopes (a new zero
 point for each), and observed transits.  This structure is the input
 to basically everything in EXOFASTv2 and is designed to be easily
 extensible. To add a new derived parameter to the output table, add
 it here, then calculate it in DERIVEPARS. To add a new fitted
 parameter, add it here, then use it in EXOFAST_CHI2V2 to influence
 the model or the likelihood/chi^2 directly.

 Priors may be applied to any parameter (fitted or derived).

 CALLING SEQUENCE:

   This code is deep in the bowels of EXOFASTv2 and is not intended
   to be user callable.

 INPUTS:
  See $EXOFAST_PATH/exofastv2.pro for an explanation of most inputs.
 
  NVALUES  - By default, parameter.value is a scalar. Set this
             to make it an array of length NVALUES.

  SILENT   - If set, supress output messages.

  CHI2FUNC - A string specifying the name of the function that
             computes the model's chi^2.

 NAME:
   MKTICSED

 PURPOSE: 
   Create the SED input file for EXOFASTv2 based on TICv8.2. It also
   creates a minimal prior file that includes Gaia DR3 parallax,
   upper limits from Galactic dust maps, and starting values for the
   star from TICv8.2.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
   mkticsed, ticid [, PRIORFILE=, SEDFILE=, /FRANCE, RA=, DEC=]
 
 INPUTS:

  TICID - A string representing the numerical portion of the TICID
          for your target. This can be retrived from EXOFOP.
          https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/tess/

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:

  PRIORFILE - The name of the output prior file. By default, it will
              be TICID.priors
  SEDFILE   - The name of the output SED file. By default, it will be
              TICID.sed 
  RA/DEC    - The right ascension and declination of the object, in
              decimal degrees. If RA/DEC are provided, we find the
              TICID closest to the provided RA/Dec. This can be
              problematic for high proper motion stars or stars in
              crowded fields, so it is strongly recommended to use
              the TICID instead.

 OPTIONAL KEYWORDS:

  FRANCE    - Use the FRANCE mirror when querying vizier. By default,
              we use the CfA mirror.
  
 EXAMPLES:

  ;; make an sed and prior file for WASP-4:
  mkticsed, '402026209', priorfile='wasp4.priors', sedfile='wasp4.sed'

 PURPOSE: 
   Calculates the best ephemeris from a list of transit times and
   plots the O-C diagram
 
 CALLING SEQUENCE:
    OMC, 'filename' [,period, t0=t0,/ps,epsname=epsname]

 INPUTS:

    FILENAME - The filename of a text file with columns T_C, error,
               and optionally telescope name. If telescope name is
               given, each unique telescope name will be plotted
               with a different color. The error must be in days.
               NOTE: "#" may be used as a comment string.

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:
    
    PERIOD   - The period of the transit. If not given, the program
               will attempt to calculate it from the lowest common
               multiple of transits.
               NOTE: This may result in integer aliases depending on
               when the transits were taken.
    T0       - The zero point of the ephemeris. If not specified, the
               transit time closest to the error-weighted mean of all
               input times will be used, which minimizes the error in
               the ephemeris.
    EPSNAME  - The name of the encapsulated postscript file; default
               is omc.eps.

 OPTIONAL KEYWORDS:
    
    PS       - If set, an encapsulated postscript plot will be
               created. Otherwise, it will plot to the screen. It is
               not necessary to specify both PS and EPSNAME.

 OUTPUTS:

   1) Plots the O-C diagram
   2) Prints the best fit ephemeris with errors
   3) Prints the chi^2/dof of the best fit
   4) Prints the epoch, transit time, error (sec), residual (sec),
      and residual/err for each transit

 NAME:
   PLOTIMAGE

 AUTHOR:
   Craig B. Markwardt, NASA/GSFC Code 662, Greenbelt, MD 20770
   craigm@lheamail.gsfc.nasa.gov

 PURPOSE:
   Displays an image via a "PLOT"-like interface.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
   PLOTIMAGE, img, [xrange=xrange,] [yrange=yrange,] ...

 DESCRIPTION:

   PLOTIMAGE displays an image (or slice of an image) on the current
   graphics device.  The syntax is very similar to the PLOT command,
   in the sense that an XRANGE and YRANGE for the plot can be
   specified.  

   PLOTIMAGE keeps separate the notions of the image coordinate
   system and the displayed coordinate system, which allows any input
   image to be "cropped," "zoomed," or "flipped."

   PLOTIMAGE allows the user to express image extents in physical
   units rather than pixel units.

   The image coordinate system specifies the physical coordinates of
   original image data, IMG.  The image is considered to be a 2D
   array (IMG = ARRAY(NX,NY)), where the values are attached to the
   midpoint of each geometric pixel.  The image has NX columns and NY
   rows.  Physical coordinates are attached to each pixel by using
   the IMGXRANGE and IMGYRANGE keywords.  The IMGXRANGE keyword is a
   two-element array specifying the "left" and "right" boundaries of
   the image pixels in physical units; the IMGYRANGE keyword
   specifies the "top" and "bottom" boundaries of the image.  This is
   illustrated in Figure 1 for a simplified case.

      Figure 1.  Simplified example of a 2x2 input image,
      demonstrating that IMG[*,*] values refer to the pixel
      mid-points, and that IMGXRANGE and IMGYRANGE ranges specify the
      physical coordinates of the outer edges of the image extent in
      X and Y, respectively.
 

   The displayed plot coordinate system is entirely independent of
   the native image coordinates.  Users can set up the plot scale
   using any combination of {X,Y}RANGE, {X,Y}STYLE and/or {X,Y}LOG,
   as they would for any IDL plot, using physical units.  The input
   image will then be overlayed on this coordinate system.

   If the displayed plot coordinates are narrower than the native
   image coordinates, then the displayed portion of the image will be
   cropped to fit.  If the displayed coordinates are wider than the
   native image coordinates, then the image will be displayed with
   blank spaces on either side (see Figure 2).  A mirror "flip" is
   also possible in X and/or Y, if XRANGE or YRANGE are specified in
   reverse order.

     Figure 2.  Example of an image whose native image coordinates
     are embedded in a wider plot display range.

   The standard [XY]STYLE keywords can be used to style either axis.
   However at the very least [XY]STYLE=1 is always implied, i.e. the
   plot limits exactly obey the [XY]RANGE keyword values.

   If XLOG or YLOG are set, then the image is assumed to be sampled
   on a logarithmic grid, and logarithmic axes are displayed
   accordingly.  PLOTIMAGE does not attempt to resample the image
   from linear scale to logarithmic scale, or reverse.

   Psuedocolor images may be of any type, but must rescaled to a byte
   range by using the RANGE keyword.  By default the color range used
   in the rescaling operation is 0 to !D.N_COLORS - 3B.  The extra
   two color values are reserved for the background and default pen
   colors.  This behavior can be adjusted by specifying the BOTTOM
   and/or NCOLORS keywords.

   Truecolor images must always be of type BYTE and one of their
   dimensions must have 3 elements, corresponding to the three color
   planes of the image.


 INPUTS:

   IMG - Array to be displayed.  For single-plane images (i.e.,
         pseudocolor), the image must be two dimensional and of any
         real numeric type.  For images that are not of BYTE type,
         the RANGE keyword must be supplied, and then PLOTIMAGE will
         rescale the image values to a byte range.

         An image declared as ARRAY(NX,NY) will be NX pixels in the
         x-direction and NY pixels in the y-direction.  The image is
         resampled to fill the desired display region (and optionally
         smoothed).

         For three-plane images (i.e., truecolor) the image must be
         of type BYTE.  One of the dimensions of the array must have
         three elements.  Hence it must be one of BYTARR(NX, NY, 3),
         BYTARR(NX, 3, NY) or BYTARR(3, NX, NY).  The 3-element
         dimension is recognized automatically.

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:
   NONE

 INPUT KEYWORD PARAMETERS:

   IMGXRANGE, IMGYRANGE - Each is a two component vector that
                          describes the X and Y position of the outer
                          edges of the first and last pixels.
                          Default: IMGXRANGE = [0,NX]
                                   IMGYRANGE = [0,NY]

   XRANGE, YRANGE - Each is a two component vector that specifies the
                    X and Y plot ranges, respectively.  These values
                    are not required to coincide with IMG[XY]RANGE.
                    Default: XRANGE=IMGXRANGE
                             YRANGE=IMGYRANGE

   POSITION - Position of the inner plot window in the standard
              graphics keyword format.  Overrides PANEL and SUBPANEL.

   INTERP - if set, interpolate (smooth) the image before displaying.
            This keyword applies to the screen displays.  For printed
            images that are coarser than MIN_DPI, the image is
            implicitly interpolated regardless of INTERP.

   PRESERVE_ASPECT - if set, preserve the aspect ratio of the
                     original image (in pixels).  The result will be
                     the largest image that fits in the display
                     region while maintaining approximately square
                     pixels.  However, PIXEL_ASPECT_RATIO overrides
                     PRESERVE_ASPECT.  The POSITION keyword will be
                     reset upon output to the ultimate image
                     position.
                     DEFAULT: not set (image will fill POSITION rectangle)

   PIXEL_ASPECT_RATIO - The ratio of width to height for each pixel.
                        If specified, then the image will be scaled
                        so that each pixel has the specified aspect
                        ratio.  If not specified, then the image will
                        be scaled independently in X and Y in order
                        to fill the POSITION rectangle.  NOTE: If you
                        want to change the overall image aspect
                        ratio, then use the POSITION keyword.
                  DEFAULT: undefined (image will fill POSITION rectangle)

   MIN_DPI - if printing, the minimum dot-per-inch pixel resolution
             for the resulting image.  Output images that would be
             coarser than this value are resampled to have a
             resolution of at least MIN_DPI, and smoothed.  Some
             common resolutions are: screen, 90 dpi; dot matrix, 72
             dpi; laser printer 300-600 dpi.  Note that large values
             of MIN_DPI will produce very large output files.
             Default: 0 (i.e., the output image will not be smoothed)

   RANGE - a two element vector.  If the image is single plane (i.e.,
           pseudocolor) the input image can be of any real numeric
           type, and then must be rescaled into byte range with this
           keyword.  In contrast, truecolor images must always be of
           type BYTE.  Values are scaled into byte range with the
           following statement:
              RESULT = BYTSCL(INPUT, MIN=RANGE(0), MAX=RANGE(1), $
                              TOP=NCOLORS-1) + BOTTOM
           so that pixels with an intensity RANGE(0) are set to
           BOTTOM; those with RANGE(1) are set to the maximum color.
           Default: no range scaling occurs (and the image must hence
                    be of type BYTE -- otherwise an error occurs)

   NCOLORS - number of color table values be used in the byte
             rescaling operation.
             Default: !D.N_COLORS - BOTTOM - 1 (for default pen color)

   BOTTOM - bottom-most value of the color table to be used in the
            byte rescaling operation.
            Default: 1 (for default background color)

   NOERASE - If set, the display is not erased before graphics
             operations.

   NODATA - If set, the image is not actually displayed, but
            coordinate axes may be drawn.

   NOAXES - An attempt is made to render the image without coordinate
            axes.  However, it's usually more straightforward to set 
            XSTYLE=4 or YSTYLE=4, which is the standard IDL way to
            disable coordinate axes.

   ORDER - same interpretation as the !ORDER system variable; 
           if ORDER=0, then the first pixel is drawn in the lower
           left corner; if ORDER=1, then the first pixel is drawn in
           the upper left corner.
           Default: 0


   PANEL, SUBPANEL - An alternate way to more precisely specify the
                     plot and annotation positions.  See SUBCELL.

   PLOTIMAGE will pass other keywords directly to the PLOT command
   used for generating the plot axes.  XSTYLE=1 and YSTYLE=1 are
   enforced.

 OUTPUTS:
   NONE

 PROCEDURE:

 EXAMPLE:

   This example constructs an image whose values are found by
       z(x,y) = cos(x) * sin(y)
   and x and y are in the range [-2,2] and [4,8], respectively.
   The image is then plotted, with appropriate axes.

   x = findgen(20)/5. - 2. + .1   ; 0.1 = half-pixel
   y = findgen(20)/5. + 4. + .1
   zz = cos(x) # sin(y)
   imgxrange = [-2.,2.]           ; extend to pixel edges
   imgyrange = [4.,8.]
   plotimage, bytscl(zz), imgxrange=imgxrange, imgyrange=imgyrange

   This second example plots the same image, but with a plot range
   much larger than the image's.

   xr=[-10.,10]
   yr=[-10.,10]
   plotimage, bytscl(zz), imgxrange=imgxrange, imgyrange=imgyrange, $

 NAME:
   QUADLD

 PURPOSE: 
   Interpolates the quadratic limb darkening tables of Claret and
   Bloemen (2011). http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011A%26A...529A..75C

 DESCRIPTION:
   Loads an IDL save file found in $EXOFAST_PATH/quadld/, then
   does a 3D linear interpolation of the table. 

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
    coeffs = quadld(logg, teff, feh, band [,MODEL=, METHOD=, VT=]);
 INPUTS:
    LOGG - The log of the stellar surface gravity
    TEFF - The stellar effective temperature
    FEH  - The stellar metallicity
    BAND - The observed bandpass. Allowed values are those defined in
           Claret and Bloemen:
             U,B,V,R,I,J,H,K, (Johnson/Cousins)
             u',g',r',i',z', (Sloan)
             Kepler, CoRoT, 
             Spitzer 3.6 um, Spitzer 4.5 um, Spitzer 5.8 um Spitzer 8.0 um, 
             u,b,v,y (Stromgren)

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:
    MODEL  - The atmospheric model used to determine the limb
             darkening values. Choose ATLAS or PHOENIX (default ATLAS).
    METHOD - The method used. Choose L or F (default L)
    VT     - The microturbulent velocity (0,2,4,or 8, default 2)
   
 RESULT:
    The quadradic limb darkening parameters

 COMMON BLOCKS:
   LD_BLOCK - This is a self-contained block that stores the
              contents of the IDL save files. This common block saves
              the expensive step of restoring the same save files
              for repeated calls (e.g., during and MCMC fit).

 MODIFICATION HISTORY
 
  2012/06 -- Public release -- Jason Eastman (LCOGT)
  2013/01 -- Changed save filenames so they're not case sensitive
             (now works with OSX) -- thanks Stefan Hippler.
  2019/08 -- Now rejects steps outside of bounds

 NAME:
   READIPAC

 PURPOSE:
   Reads the http://exoplanets.org/csv-files/exoplanets.csv database into an
   IDL structure for easy plotting and manipulation.

   See http://exoplanets.org/help/common/data for the definitions
   of each tag.

 OPTIONAL KEYWORDS:
   UPDATE - By default, if exoplanets.csv exists, it will not
            retrieve a new copy. Set this keyword to wget the csv
            file and overwrite exoplanets.csv. It will only overwrite
            it if the copy on the server is newer. This program is
            about 25% slower when this keyword is specified
            unnecessarily and 2x slower when it actually needs to
            update.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
   result = readexo([/update])

 EXAMPLE - Print all data for HAT-P-13 b:

   planetdata = readexo(/update)
   match = where(planetdata.name eq 'HAT-P-13 b')
   names = tag_names(planetdata)
   if match[0] ne -1 then for i=0, n_tags(planetdata)-1 do $
     print, names[i], planetdata.(i)[match], format='(a15,a100)'

 DEPENDENCIES:
   wget

 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
   EXOFAST_PATH  - The environment variable specifying the directory
                   in which to save/look for the CSV file. If not set,
                   the program will use the current working directory.

 NOTES: 
   All data types are strings for robustness and generality (no
   update to this program is required if new rows or columns are
   added to the database). Converting to numeric values is trivial,
   but be sure to use the appropriate precision (eg, to convert ra
   from hours to degrees, do radeg = planetdata.ra*15.d0, not radeg =
   planetdata.ra*15).

   Be aware that the order of tags or even the tagnames may change if
   the database changes.

 NAME:
   REMAKE_CORNER

 PURPOSE: 
   Creates a corner plot of several different fits overlaid on top
   of each other using the IDL save files as output by exofastv2.pro.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
   remake_corner, 'savpath' [,TAGS=,LATEXNAMES=,LEGENDTXT=,PSNAME=]

 INPUTS:
  SAVPATH    - A string resolved by file_search or an array of
               filenames specifying the names of all the idl save
               files to compare.  
               See NSAMPLE if files are large
  TAGS       - A string array specifying the tagnames (parameters) to
               compare. Default is
               ['mstar','rstar','rhostar','logg','teff','feh','initfeh','age','lstar','eep']
  LATEXNAMES - A string array specifying the textoidl axis labels
               that corresponds to each of the tags above. If not the
               same length as TAGS, it will use the structure's latex
               property, but that doesn't always look pretty in
               textoidl. Empty strings will use the the structure's
               latex property.
  PSNAME     - A string specifying the name of the postscript file to
               output. If not specified, the plots are made to the
               screen.
  LEGENDTXT  - A string array corresponding to each save file that
               specifies the legend txt. Default is the filenames.
  NSAMPLE    - A scalar that specifies how many (random) samples to
               take from each parameter. Default uses all. Useful for
               memory management if plotting data from many large files
  POSITION   - A 2-element array specifying the normalized X and Y
               coordinates of the top left corner of the legend
  POSTERIORS - When this keyword is set, text files of the posteriors
               will be output with the same name as the input files,
               replacing 'idl' with 'txt'.

 This procedure sets default values for positional and keyword arguments to
 IDL procedures and functions.

 :Categories:
    Utilities

 :Params:
    argument: in, required
         The augument variable you are setting the default value of. If this variable
         is undefined, the `defaultValue` will be assigned to it. Otherwise, the argument
         variable will not change.
    defaultvalue: in, required
         The default value that will be assigned to the argument variable ONLY if the argument
         variable is undefined. If this variable is undefined, the argument variable will
         be treated as if the BOOLEAN keyword had been set.

 :Keywords:
    boolean: in, optional, type=integer
         If this keyword is set, the argument value will always be forced to return with a 
         value of 0 or 1.
    range: in, optional
         A two-element array that gives the accepted range of the variable. The output argument
         will be forced into this data range: range[0] > argument < range[1].

 :Examples:
    Here is how to use this program::
    
      FUNCTION Action, arg1, arg2, MULTIPLY=multiply
  
         SetDefaultValue, arg1, 1
         SetDefaultValue, arg2, 2
         SetDefaultValue, multiply, 1, /BOOLEAN 
     
         IF multiply THEN RETURN, arg1 * arg2 ELSE RETURN, arg1 + arg2
     
      END

 NAME:
       TEXTOIDL_STRTOK
 PURPOSE:
       Retrieve portion of string up to token.
 CATEGORY:
       text/strings
 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       new = textoidl_strtok( old, token )
 INPUTS:
       old   -- String to be split.  Contains text after    in, out
                token on output.
       token -- Token to use in splitting old.              in
 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
       /TRIM -- set to remove leading blanks from old 
                before returning.
       /HELP -- print useful message and exit.
 OUTPUTS:
       new   -- portion of string up to token.              out
       old   -- portion of old after token.                 out, in
 COMMON BLOCKS:
 SIDE EFFECTS:
       Input parameter old is modified.
 NOTES:
       Token may be one or more characters.
       If token is not found, returns old and sets old to ''.
 EXAMPLE:
       If old is 'foo44 bar', then textoidl_strtok( old, '44' ) would return
       'foo', and upon return, old will be left with ' bar'.  If /TRIM
       were set, old would be 'bar' on return.

       If old='xyz', then new=textoidl_strtok(old,'a') would return with
       new='xyz' and old=''.
 THANKS:
       To D. Linder who wrote GETTOK, part of the goddard library,
       upon which this is based.

 NAME:
       TEXTOIDL_STRTRANS
 PURPOSE:
       Translate all occurences of one substring to another.
 CATEGORY:
       text/strings
 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       new = textoidl_strtrans(oldstr,from,to,ned)
 INPUTS:
       oldstr -- string on which to operate.              in
                 May be an array.
       from   -- substrings to be translated. May be      in
                 an array.
       to     -- what strings in from should be           in
                 translated to. May be an array.
 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
       /HELP  -- Set this to print useful message and 
                 exit.
 OUTPUTS:
       new    -- Translated string. Array if oldstr is    out          
                 an array.
       ned    -- number of substitutions performed in     out
                 oldstr.  Array if oldstr is an array.
 COMMON BLOCKS:
 SIDE EFFECTS:
 NOTES:
       - Any of old, from, and to can be arrays.  
       - from and to must have the same number of elements.
 EXAMPLE:
       inp='Many*bad!chars+in_here'
       from=['*','!','+','_']
       to  =[' ',' ',' ',' ']
       out = textoidl_strtrans(inp,from,to,ned)
       Will produce out='Many bad chars in here', and set ned to 4.

 NAME:
       TEXTOIDL_TRANS_SUB_SUPER
 PURPOSE:
       Translate TeX sub/superscripts to IDL sub/superscripts.
 CATEGORY:
       text/strings
 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       new = textoidl_trans_sub_super( old )
 INPUTS:
       old       -- string to be translated from TeX to IDL.   in
 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
       /RECURSED -- set if this function is being called 
                    recursively.

 OUTPUTS:
       new       -- string old converted from TeX to IDL       out
 COMMON BLOCKS:
 SIDE EFFECTS:
 NOTES:
       - For best results, when both a sub and superscript are used,
         place the shorter of the two first (e.g. 'N^{a}_{bbbb}' is
         better than 'N_{bbbb}^{a}').
       - Single character sub/super scripts do not need to be
         protected by braces.
       - Sub/superscripts may be nested (e.g. 'N^{N_1^N}').
 EXAMPLE:
       out = textoidl_trans_sub_super( 'N^2_{big}' )
       Then out='N!U2!N!Dbig!N' which looks like it should on the
       display.

 NAME:
   TRANSITGIF

 PURPOSE: 
   Creates an animated gif of a transit from exoplanets.org.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
   TRANSITGIF, ['pname',PARS=,BAND=,CADENCE=,PARS=,YMIN=,BAK=,
                /YELLOW,/DISPLAY,/SAVEFRAMES,/UPDATE]

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:
   PNAME     - The name of the planet from exoplanets.org (not case
               sensitive). The output file will be the planet name
               stripped of spaces + .gif. 
   PARS      - A 10 element array of custom parameters with which to
               make a transit animation:
                PARS[0] = period (days)
                PARS[1] = eccentricity
                PARS[2] = omega_star (radians)
                PARS[3] = inclination (radians)
                PARS[4] = a/Rstar 
                PARS[5] = Rp/Rstar
                PARS[6] = logg (cgs)
                PARS[7] = Teff (K)
                PARS[8] = [Fe/H]
                PARS[9] = Rstar (R_sun)
               NOTE: PNAME or PARS must be specified. If PARS is
               specified and PNAME is not, the output will be "transit.gif".
   BAND      - The bandpass for the limb darkening calculation (see
               quadld.pro for allowed values). Default = 'Sloanz'
   CADENCE   - A frame is generated every CADENCE minutes for a
               duration of 2*T_FWHM*MAXSTAR/RSTAR. This duration
               forces the X axis of the plot to be on the same scale as
               the drawing, ignoring the curvature of the planet's orbit.
               Default = 5.
               NOTE: A constant cadence between animations means the
               duration of the animation (number of frames)
               corresponds to the duration of the transit.
   NPOINTS   - The number of pixels in the image of the star. Larger
               images may break the conversion to gif.
               Default = 299. 
   YMIN      - The minimum of transit plot. Default is 0.985
               NOTE: A constant minimum makes the plots to scale from
               animation to animation, but this default cuts off some
               deeper planets.
   BAK       - A 3-element array containing the RGB values of the
               background color. Default is [135,206,250]; (sky blue)
               Use [255,255,255] for white.
   MAXSTAR   - The size of the maximum star, in R_sun. A star of this
               size will be centered left/right and span the top half of
               the image. The total image is 4*MAXSTAR
               square. Keeping MAXSTAR the same (positive value)
               for multiple animations means they will be to
               scale. Default = 1.5.
               Numbers between -1 and 0 are interpreted as a
               fractions of RSTAR (e.g, -1 ensures the star will take
               up the entire range; -0.9 leaves a nice margin). Negative
               numbers are useful if you're making a single
               animation and want it to fit nicely.
               NOTE: If the Rstar is larger than MAXSTAR, it will
               produce an error.
 OPTIONAL KEYWORDS:
   YELLOW     - Makes the star yellow and the planet black, instead of
                their color temperatures. 
                NOTE: Output file is then PNAME.yellow.gif
   DISPLAY    - Spawns firefox to display the animated gif.
   SAVEFRAMES - The individual PNG frames are deleted upon
                completion. Set this keyword to keep them.
   UPDATE     - Update the local copy of exoplanets.csv

 OUTPUTS:
  pname.gif - An animated gif of the transit.

 EXAMPLES:  
   ;; creates an animation of HAT-P-3b, called 'HAT-P-3b.gif'
   transitgif, 'HAT-P-3b'

   ;; creates an animation Earth, called 'transit.gif'
   pars = [365.242199d0,0.01671123d0,!dpi/2d0,!dpi/2d0,215.094177d0,$
           0.0091705248d0,4.43834417d0,5778d0,0d0,1d0]
   transitgif, pars=pars

   ;; creates an animation of Jupiter, called "Jupiter.gif'
   transitgif, 'Jupiter',pars=[4332.59d0,0.048498,!dpi/2d0,!dpi/2d0,215.094177d0*5.20260d,0.102792236d0,4.43834417d0,5778d0,0d0,1d0]

   ;; Creates animations for all transiting exoplanets from exoplanets.org
   planets = readexo(/update)
   transit = where(planets.transit,ntransits)
   for i=0, ntransits-1 do $
      transitgif, strcompress(planets.name[transit[i]],/remove_all),$
      maxstar=max(double(planets.rstar[transit])), band='Sloanz',$
      ymin=1d0-max(double(planets.depth[transit]))

 DEPENDENCIES:
   convert. While IDL can write animated gifs directly,
   they're only 8 bit. In color, that creates unsightly
   ringing, so we use convert instead.

 NAME:
   UPDATETIME

 NOTE: READ THE DOCUMENTATION -- ITS USE IS EASY TO GET WRONG!!!!

 PURPOSE:
   This function updates three files required to maintain the most
   precise time. These files are used by EXOFAST and related codes.

   1) The leap second file, updates whenever there is a new leap
      second. Typically every ~6 months. It is requires for ~1 second
      precision.

   2) The IERS file keeps track of meausured changes in the
      Earth's rotation and is required for ms precision.

   3) The BIPM file tracks the difference between TT(TAI) and
      TT(BIPM) and is required for microsecond precison. Note that
      this can only be done precisely months after the time in
      question.

 NOTE:
   There are no requirements that these files are maintained in a
   backward compatible way. Changes to the source file formats or
   file locations may occur, which could break this code. Care should
   be taken to ensure this function is operating as intended. We will
   update it as required, but may be slow to identify such
   changes. Please email me (jason.eastman@cfa.harvard.edu) if the
   most up to date version does not work.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
   updatetime

 NOTE: The files this code grabs update regularly. This function
 should be run at least monthly. The easiest way to ensure this is to
 set it up as a cronjob by adding a line like this in your crontab:

   0 0 15 * * . /h/onion0/.bashrc ; idl -e "updatetime"

 ****** BE SURE TO TEST THIS! IT IS TRICKIER THAN IT SEEMS ******

 The first part
   0 0 15 * * 
 will run it at midnight on the 15th of every month. You may wish to
 randomize the day and time to distribute the load on their FTP
 server. The second part
   . /h/onion0/.bashrc 
 sources a bashrc file that defines the required environment
 variables ($ASTRO_DATA, $IDL_PATH, and $PATH). Just because it works
 in your terminal does not mean it will work inside crontab. You must
 change it so it sources your profile file. If your crontab shell is
 different than your usual shell, you may need to write a new profile
 file for your crontab. The last part
   idl -e "updatetime"
 runs this program. idl must be in your $PATH for this to work (or
 you can specify the full path to IDL in the call). 

 DEPENDENCIES:
   You must have the $ASTRO_DATA environment variable set. This is
   the directory where the files will be copied.

 NAME:
       WAVELETLIKE
 PURPOSE:
       Calculates the (log) likelihood for a given vector to be
       described for parameters sigma_r and sigma_w as 1/f noise plus
       white noise as detailed by Carter & Winn (2009)

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       result = waveletlike(x, sigma_r, sigma_w)

 INPUTS:
       X - Data vector, must be a power of two
       SIGMA_R - Red noise amplitude parameter (not equal to
                 1/f-component RMS)
       SIGMA_W - White noise amplitude parameter (approximately equal
                 to white-component RMS)

 OUTPUTS:
       RESULT - log(likelihood) as defined in Eqn. (32) of Carter &
                Winn (2009)

 NOTES:
       Refer to the paper by Carter & Winn (2009) for theory and
       details.  In the notation of that paper, gamma=1 for this
       algorithm.

 REVISION HISTORY:
